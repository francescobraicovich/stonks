However, even seasoned investors can find some use out of this by getting back to the basics. This quick guide isn't meant to focus on financial metrics, but in an effort to explore companies based on the world around us.\n\nPreface: This is directed for individuals that are just starting to invest, in hopes of empowering them to continue to grow upon the knowledge they learn on in this post! This is also a post to help highlight a new social investing platform I've been building called [Mainstreet](https://mainstreetportfolio.com/) (currently in beta) that helps you invest with your friends, track your portfolios, and build communities with one another. Happy investing!\n\n**How To Find Stocks (for the Normal Investor)**\n\nOne of the most common questions I get when talking to someone just getting into investing, is something along the lines of \u201cWhich stocks are good?\u201d or \u201cHow do I find stocks to invest in?\u201d. Some of the reasons individuals choose not to invest is due to the \u201clack of knowledge\u201d or perhaps they are \u201cintimidated by the market\u201d. These are all valid reasons to not invest, but I feel like by providing the education and resources to learn about these topics in an easy and digestible manner will help people overcome these barriers and feel empowered to take control of their wealth, whether it\u2019s through real estate, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll dive into some of the strategies and methods I used to help gain knowledge and insight when investing in the stock market. Keep in mind this is not the definitive guide, but it\u2019s steps that I took to help me become more financially literate about the stock market. Everyone\u2019s path to financial education is different and unique and this is only meant to provide a different perspective for someone just starting out.\n\n**Pay Attention to the World Around You**\n\nThe first thing I usually tell people is, start to observe the world around you and the businesses that are close to your network. You\u2019ll easily be able to find many companies if you start to shift your mindset and look at how the world functions.\n\nFirst, look at what kind of products or services you consume. Do you need to get your fix of vanilla latte at Starbucks ($SBUX) in the morning? More of a fast food person? Let\u2019s look at McDonalds ($MCD), Chipotle ($CMG), Shake Shack ($SHAK), or Restaurant Brands International ($QSR). Are you a hardcore gamer? Well, I\u2019m sure one of your games or consoles comes from Sony ($SNE), Nintendo ($NTDOY), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), or Microsoft ($MSFT). Or maybe you\u2019ve been working from home? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had to buy some products from Amazon ($AMZN) or Wayfair ($W) to spruce up your office space. You\u2019re probably also using things like Zoom ($ZM), Google Drive ($GOOG or $GOOGL), or Slack to keep yourself productive during the day.\n\n**Build a Watchlist**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got the brain working a little, it\u2019s important to start building a watchlist of all the stocks you\u2019ve thought of. You can use your broker watchlist tool, or even an app like Yahoo Finance, WeBull, etc. Sort them in a way that works for you, whether it\u2019s by sector (financial, tech, industrials), subsector (gaming, oil, e-commerce), or even by priority (Watchlist Tier 1, Watchlist Tier 2, etc.)\n\nOrganization is key when building your watchlist. You\u2019ll want to have them organized because it\u2019ll help you get a quick glance of what\u2019s happening in the market at any given time. By checking on the stocks you\u2019ve added to your watchlist periodically, you\u2019ll learn how they move according to catalysts (market news, earnings, etc) and be able to plan how and when you\u2019d like to invest in them.\n\n**Search within an Index Fund or ETF**\n\nA great way to search up companies is by looking at current index fund or ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) allocations. With index funds, you can look at the holdings of the S&amp;P500 (Top 500 American companies) or the Nasdaq 100 (Most active, largest 100 Nasdaq companies). At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of the S&amp;P500 are:\n\n1. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)\n2. Microsoft Corp ($MSFT)\n3. Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN)\n4. Facebook, Inc. ($FB)\n5. Alphabet Inc. Class A ($GOOGL)\n6. Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG)\n7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc ($BRK.B)\n8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ($JPM)\n9. Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA)\n10. Johnson &amp; Johnson ($JNJ)\n\nAnother way is to look into the holdings of an ETF. There are tons of ETFs out there that track indices like $SPY and $QQQ, which track the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, as well as more focused sector ETFs, like the ARK Innovation Fund ($ARKK) or the O\u2019Shares Global Internet Giants Fund ($OGIG).\n\nOne of my favorites is ARKK, as they focus on disruptive innovation and change. So, for example, if something like this was to resonate with you, looking into their top holdings will give you some insight on what kinds of companies you\u2019d need to do research on to gain exposure to this particular strategy. At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of ARKK are:\n\n1. Tesla, Inc ($TSLA)\n2. Teladoc Health, Inc. ($TDOC)\n3. Roku, Inc. ($ROKU)\n4. Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)\n5. Square, Inc. ($SQ)\n6. Shopify, Inc ($SHOP)\n7. Spotify Technology SA ($SPOT)\n8. Twilio, Inc (TWLO)\n9. Coinbase Global, Inc ($COIN)\n10. Unity Software, Inc ($U)\n\nHopefully looking into index funds or ETFs like the ones listed above help spark curiosity and the urge to build on your own knowledge!\n\n**Invest in Things You Understand (Personal, Business)**\n\nAnother piece of advice I like to give people is to only invest in areas of the market you understand. For example, if I see a sector like biotech or cybersecurity shoot up 50% in the last three months, but I don\u2019t really understand how this industry works, don\u2019t put your money in it. Simple as that. If the whole stock market started to fall, these will be the easiest to target as a potential sell because you don\u2019t understand the industry or the company at all. Your conviction on the stock is low so incentive to hold onto it for the long term is also low.\n\nFor me, I\u2019m a big gamer and I understand the industry well. To compare it to the previous example above, I can take those companies and further extrapolate to build upon my research using my existing knowledge. As a result, I\u2019m aware that gaming consoles use chips from Intel ($INTC), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), as well as GPU processors from Nvidia ($NVDA). Many video games are developed on software applications like Unity ($U). I\u2019m also aware that a large population of gamers and gaming companies come from Asia and Europe, therefore I can look into stocks like Ubisoft ($UBI), Capcom ($CCOEF), or even Tencent Holdings ($TCEHY). What about gaming accessories from Corsair ($CRSR) or Logitech ($LOGI)? And let\u2019s not forget about Gamestop ($GME)!\n\nAnother great way to leverage your knowledge is to look at your workplace and how the business is structured from within. Does your company utilize products or services from other companies? If you work at a software company, perhaps you use Cisco ($CSCO) or Ciena ($CIEN) for your networking. If your company uses customer or sales support, you may be using something like Salesforce ($CRM), Twilio ($TWLO), or Zendesk ($ZEN). To optimize your business, your company may also be leveraging cybersecurity services like Palo Alto ($PALO), Okta ($OKTA), or Crowdstrike ($CRWD). By looking within your own workplace, you\u2019ll be able to do a bit of deeper digging to find stocks that services businesses and aren\u2019t as customer facing.\n\nUnderstanding an industry well allows you to build your conviction in that industry. By fully grasping the ins and outs, you\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re invested in. This prevents panicking or selling if you suddenly see a red day, because you know what the company is fundamentally and potentially capable of. It also allows you to get invested in the companies you\u2019re buying, ultimately feeling like a small owner of the company, which is exactly what the function of stocks are.\n\n**Diversify your Portfolio**\n\nSo now, you\u2019ve done a bit of research and found a ton of stocks you might potentially invest in. Now what? Well, now is where you want to think about risk management and portfolio diversity.\n\nFrom Investopedia, diversification is a \u201crisk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\u201d\n\nHow do I know what\u2019s diversified enough? Great question, but that\u2019s up to your personal risk tolerance. Try not to allocate all your stocks into one single sector or area of the market. By broadening out in sector (tech, industrial), subsector (5G, banks), geography (US, Asia, Europe), market cap (large, medium, small), and more, you can feel comfortable and confident with your investments. The last thing you want to be doing is checking your stocks every minute and wondering if you should buy more or sell it off. Also consider the timeline of your allocations. The majority of my portfolio is in long-term investments (3+ years), but I do have a small portion of my portfolio allocated to mid-term and momentum investments (less than two years), such as options and swing trading. It\u2019s up to each individual investor to determine these allocations and stay committed to knowing when to change your allocation based on your time horizon.\n\nConsider this portfolio of $10000 dollars: (Stock, dollar amount\\[%\\], sector/subsector/geography/market cap)\n\n* Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA - $1000 (10%) - Tech / EV / USA / Large\n* Alibaba Group ($BABA) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / E-Commerce / ASIA / Large\n* Bank of America ($BAC) - $1000 (10%) - Financials / Banking / USA / Large\n* GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Pharma / EU / Large\n* Brookfield Renewable ($BEP)- $1000 (10%) - Energy / Renewable / CAN / Large\n* Papa John\u2019s Int. ($PZZA)- $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Consumer/ USA / Mid\n* Ubisoft Entertainment ($UBI) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / Gaming / EU / Mid\n* Barrick Gold ($GOLD) - $1000 (10%) - Industrials / Mining / CAN / Mid\n* Aurora Cannabis ($ACB) - $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Cannabis / CAN / Small\n* Nano-X Imaging ($NNOX) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Telehealth / Israel / Small\n\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve been able to allocate into many different sectors, subsectors, geographies, and market caps. If one of these companies were to disappear tomorrow, we\u2019d still have 90% of our portfolio remaining.\n\nOf our mock portfolio, our sector allocation is the following: 30% Technology, 20% Consumer, 20% Health, and 10% each in Financials, Energy, and Industrials. Our subsector allocation is fully diversified in 10 subsectors of the market: Electric Vehicles, E-Commerce, Banking, Pharma, Renewable Energy, Consumer, Gaming, Mining, Cannabis, and Telehealth. In terms of geography, our allocation is the following: 30% USA, 30% Canada, 20% Europe, 10% Asia, and 10% Israel. With our market cap, our allocation is the following: 50% large, 30% mid, and 20% small. As you can see, this portfolio is well diversified in terms of sector, subsector, region, and market cap. These allocations will ultimately be up to you, as you will be in control of your portfolio.\n\n**Now You\u2019re Ready!**\n\nAnd that\u2019s it, we\u2019ve learned how to find stocks by looking at your surroundings using your own knowledge from your personal and work life and now you understand how to properly diversify a portfolio based on your own risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\n**Mainstreet**\n\nThis article is part of a series of articles aimed at assisting investors to take control of their wealth on Mainstreet.

It\u2019s simple: the vast majority of retail traders are latecomers to trends. They follow the crowds instead of leading \u2013 they try to get in on the tail end of a movement instead of getting in on the ground floor of an opportunity.\n\nThe key to powerful, sustained returns in stocks is to catch a trend in the early stages. The best among these are founder-led companies \u2013 and when you pick the right ones, the gains could potentially be in the thousands of percentage points:\n\n\\- Apple\u00a0was co-founded by Steve Jobs in 1976. Apple stock has yielded returns of roughly 376,000% since 1981. From 1997 to now, we're talking about 2,000x one\u2019s initial investment.\n\n\\- Jeff Bezos founded Amazon from his garage in\u00a0Bellevue, Washington, on July 5, 1994. Amazon stock shares have gained an astounding 200,000% since the company\u2019s IPO.\n\n\\- FedEx was founded in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1971 by\u00a0Yale University student Frederick W. Smith. He drew up the company\u2019s concept in a term paper at Yale, in which he called for a system specifically designed for urgent deliveries. Today, FedEx has a global presence and a market cap of $65 billion.\n\n\\- Salesforce was started in 1999 by former\u00a0Oracle\u00a0executive\u00a0Marc Benioff, who ultimately helped develop the incipient concepts of cloud computing, CRM, and software-as-a-service into the well-developed ideas they are in the 2020s. That company is worth nearly $250 billion today.\n\n\\- Jensen Huang founded Nvidia in 1993 with a belief that the next wave of computing would be graphics-based because it could solve problems that general-purpose computing could not. Today, the Nvidia is valued at a whopping $555 billion.\n\nWhat ground-floor opportunity might give us the next legendary success story and life-changing returns? In the 2020\u2019s, investors should look to the plant-based foods industry for hyper-growth.\n\nBelieve it or not, the market for plant-based meat is forecast to grow to $450 billion, and to make up a quarter of the $1.8 trillion meat market by 2040, according to consulting firm Kearney, which also sees animal protein peaking in 2025 (source: Bloomberg News, 5/3/21).

It has actually been with us for quite a while now. And while it has tremendous market growth potential, at this point it seems like the good companies are already well established and over priced. But rest assured, there are still a couple of hidden gems out there that are only at the very beginning of their business evolution. Luckily, they also hold great potential for becoming serious disruptors and make innovative use of the IoT. \n\nThe IoT (internet of things) is simply a fancy name referring to online networks of devices that are connected to the internet and are communicating with other devices in the same network via connections to data centres. Think of smart light bulbs that you can turn on using a phone app or a smart house where you can control lights, music, locks, etc. online. These are all examples of IoT based developments. \n\nMore recently, new IoT companies are moving away from just focusing on connectivity and go further into application development, platform hosting and other services. With innovation growing, the IoT sector attracted nearly $20B last year and new startups are popping by everywhere and in 2020 attracted around 70% of total investments in IoT. Just in 2020, the IoT market grew by 20% (currently estimated at $300B) and this trend is projected to continue with a 25% CAGR in the next 5-7 years. And with market projections this positive, I\u2019ve done some digging to try and find some of these companies that I believe are still undervalued and hold the potential to double down fast. \n\n[Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) (NASDAQ: ALRM) \n\nFounded in 2000, [Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) develops cloud-based home or business security systems that are already used in millions of homes across the US and Canada. The system enables users to control their home or business devices (security cameras, lights, locks, air conditioning, etc.) through an internet based app. Alarm provides customers with its SaaS software and currently has over 100M devices connected to its data servers. In the past two years, Alarm also broadened its connectivity to include cars, cameras and water valves. \n\nALRM\u2019s market cap is currently valued at $4.1B with a share price ranging between $73-108 and an average volume of 188K. In terms of stock price action, the past 3 weeks has seen a modest 2.2% increase. While this seems to be a minor share price increase, market projections are highly positive for smart home security and ALRM\u2019s connectivity seems to provide a solid starting point.    \n\nT42 (AIM:TRAC)\n\nSimilarly to what Alarm is doing with house security, T42 is providing security solutions to the maritime shipping industry, which is currently lagging far behind what cutting-edge tech can offer. In a bid to address this market gap enter T42, an IoT, satellite-based technology company that provides tracking solutions for maritime shipping containers. T42 develops and manufactures a state-of -the-art smart lock that monitors containers and transmits real time data about security hazards to clients. T42\u2019s lock provides real time data and alerts (saved on the company\u2019s cloud server), monitoring containers\u2019 location, humidity levels, temperature, impacts, door openings etc. \n\nT42 is still in its early stages as a company, with a market cap of $8.6M GBP average volume estimated at 350K. Last week, T42 announced a $40M deal with Latin American ports which led to a 100% jump in share price jumping within a single trading session. And while T42 is still a new player in the field of IoT, its market projections are also highly positive and seeing deals starting to flow in sets it on a great course.  \n\nOther than ALRM and TRAC, there seems to be an analyst consensus about larger companies such as Cisco (CSCO), Amazon (AMZN) and Garmin (GRMN).

Shallcross, Chief Executive Officer of Synthetic Biologics. \"Enrollment in the SYN-004 Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients is underway at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (\"Washington University\") and the first patient of the first antibiotic cohort was dosed earlier this year. We believe SYN-004 has the potential to address an important and underserved patient population, and may significantly improve outcomes for allogeneic HCT recipients by preventing downstream complications often associated with disruption of the gut microbiome by intravenous (\"IV\") beta-lactam antibiotics. If enrollment proceeds as planned, we anticipate announcing topline data from the first antibiotic cohort during the **fourth quarter of 2021**, pandemic conditions permitting.\"\n\nMr. Shallcross continued, \"We were also very excited to announce the initiation of a Phase 1a single-ascending-dose clinical trial of our SYN-020 IAP program during the first quarter of 2021. To date, three out of a total of four cohorts have been dosed and we remain on track to report topline data from this study during the third quarter of 2021, pandemic conditions permitting. A second Phase 1a multiple-ascending-dose study is also expected to begin enrollment during the third quarter of 2021 with topline data expected early next year. Both studies are designed to support the advancement of SYN-020 in multiple potential therapeutic indications, including celiac disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (\"NAFLD\") and age-related metabolic and inflammatory diseases. We are very excited about the potential for this program to be a long-term value driver for our Company and look forward to sharing important updates.\"\n\nMr. Shallcross concluded, \"While we remain focused on the execution of our clinical development activities, we were also able raise net proceeds of approximately $66 million as well as $8.0 million in proceeds from the cash exercise of warrants, significantly strengthening our balance sheet and financial position. As a result of these activities, our current cash position is approximately $76.9 million. Importantly, our fortified balance sheet will fully fund our SYN-004 and SYN-020 clinical programs through proof-of-concept clinical studies, and help accelerate our other ongoing activities.\"\n\n**Clinical Development and Operational Update**\n\n* Announced Washington University has begun enrollment and the first patient was dosed in the first antibiotic cohort of the Company's Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 in allogeneic HCT recipients for the prevention of acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD)\n* Announced enrollment has commenced and three out of a total of four cohorts have been dosed in a Phase 1a SAD clinical trial of SYN-020 in healthy adult volunteers\n* Strengthened balance sheet by raising net proceeds of $66 million from the sale of common stock via the Company's At-The-Market (\"ATM\") facility and $8.0 million resulting from the cash exercise of a portion of Company's 2018 warrants during Q1 2021\n\n**Quarter Ended** **March 31, 2020** **Financial Results**\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by 2% to approximately $1.42 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from approximately $1.39 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This increase is primarily due to higher insurance costs, audit fees, and legal costs offset by a reduction in patent related legal fees, consulting fees and travel expense. The charge related to stock-based compensation expense was $82,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $65,000 the three months ended March 31, 2020.\n\nResearch and development expenses decreased by 32% to approximately $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, from approximately $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This decrease is primarily the result of lower indirect program costs for the three months ended March 31, 2021, including salary and related expense reductions, a decrease in manufacturing costs for SYN-020 and market research. In addition, as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the Company's development partner (Washington University) reduced their operating capacity during 2021 to include only essential activities as part of their pandemic response, which delayed the start of the Company's clinical trial, resulting in lower clinical trial expenses for the quarter. The research and development costs incurred during the quarter were primarily related to the Company's Phase 1a clinical trial of SYN-020 and the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of SYN-004 (ribaxamase) in allogeneic HCT recipients. The Company anticipates research and development expense to increase as ongoing clinical trials continue to enroll patients. The charge related to stock-based compensation expense was $19,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $18,000 related to stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2020.\n\nOther income was $347 for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to other income of $38,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Other income for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 is primarily comprised of interest income.\n\nCash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2021 totaled $76.9 million, an increase of $70.7 million from December 31, 2020.\n\n**About Synthetic Biologics, Inc.**\n\nSynthetic Biologics, Inc. (NYSE American: SYN) is a diversified clinical-stage company leveraging the microbiome to develop therapeutics designed to prevent and treat gastrointestinal (GI) diseases in areas of high unmet need.

Im about to present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to 75x your  money\\*\\*.\\*\\* Too much, or too good to be true? Im being conservative. Hear  me out.\n\n**First, I shall Flex:**\n\n1. I  am an MD and a Professor. To spell out the obvious, I have insight into  what matters in the medical world. Many pure researchers lack this  (cough cough Elisabeth Bik). In addition, As medical school faculty, If I  can't figure it out, I know who to ask.\n2. I started investing (profitably) before most of you were born.\n\nWhy  flex? To make it abundantly clear, my opinion on biotech investing  matters just a little. With that said, once more, listen up!\n\n**The Pickle:**\n\nYou  youngins haven't noticed, but Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of  death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. The kicker is,  there is NO effective treatment.\n\nThe  FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm. This drug has  significant adverse events. The risk of brain swelling requires serial  Brain MRIs. It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV  infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k. Most incredible is  that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate  trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make  later).\n\nAgain, for emphasis, the  FDA still approved it because the need is that severe. President Biden  recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation  over a trillion dollars.\n\n**The Fix: $SAVA**\n\nCassava  Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive  function in its CMS trial. The degree and duration of improvement have  NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic.  It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that  behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it  doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the  discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.\n\nYes,  we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc. A genuine  criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased  critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the  usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives  conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the  ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.\n\nWithout  getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere  criticisms is Phase 3 trials. There is no valid argument against this  statement. This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use  absolute phrases. If you take away only one point from this article,  then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start  early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more  about him later). Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after  the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also  threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy. Be angry,  fellow apes, be angry. Im just getting started, BTW.\n\nDo  market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal?  They do. That is why the stock price went from &lt; $1 to an ATH of  $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my  family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the  first place.\n\n**The Villan and His Massacre:**\n\nJordan  Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a \"Citizens Petition.\"  A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit)  out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical  to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed  another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.\n\nEssentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second,  sold their shares. SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the  making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog ([https://ad-science.org/](https://ad-science.org/)),  Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it  biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.\n\n1. Jordan  Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that  patients are literally dying as they wait. WTF!? Why, why why?? If you  aren't angry, somethings wrong with you. JT states he is concerned for  patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there  is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected,  JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly.  In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did  JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that  is the \\*only\\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is  safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall  continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these  petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is  horrendous (3% success rate)? Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who  uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD  in its purest form.\n2. Then  why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous  document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe  even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my  position by 30%. With that said, Im not surprised the masses started  selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent,  it's an \\*opportunity\\*\u2014a second chance to buy the stock on clearance.\n\n**The Financials:**\n\n$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue.\n\nFifty  million patients are suffering from AD globally. 6 million of those  patients reside in the US. Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American  market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs  $20k annually, just a bit over a third the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's  soon to fail drug):\n\n1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000\n\nThat  calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up  as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment  options). The current stock price is $50. The overly conservative  valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750\n\nThe above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia.\n\n**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**\n\nIf  you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading  causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a  hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of  death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment.  Thats devastating for patients, but families? It's not uncommon for  families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they \"can't  handle it anymore.\" This market is massive and unaddressed! Severely,  painfully, and gravely unaddressed.\n\nI  have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires  (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process. JT is only the  face of this farce. Behind him are many short positions making a 100  million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their  short-term gain. There is something far more concerning.\n\n**The Plot Thickens:**\n\nWhat  I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or  short-term price action. There is something much more sinister. Biogen  has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved. Now it  is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a  problem:\n\nFDA advisory committee  voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then  saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently,  a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and  Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to  support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and  Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the  country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's  AD drug. This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you  to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no  other therapy on the market. Well, what happens if a new, more effective  medication shows up?\n\n**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**\n\nBack  to our Villian JT. JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the  initial \"Citizens Patetion\") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works. Why? I  speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous  whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried  about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in  profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is  more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer. There is  little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less. When that  happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug. Biogen already  has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to  rejuvenate the companies earnings. Then expediently and as expected,  Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.\n\nI  believe that is the root issue. Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become  furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam! A group of us have  gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to  investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).\n\n**Short term price action:**\n\n1. Im  expecting the SP to bounce. After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a  perfect overreaction play. If you dont know what Im talking about, you  can look up \"overreaction with reversion to the mean.\"\n2. Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within \"weeks to months.\"\n3. Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks. (\"Soon\" per Remi)\n4. Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.\n\n\\#SAVA's  float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted  with utilization of &gt;90%. It'll take very little to make SAVA move,  big. Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.\n\nI  have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on  SAVA. My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!). I'll  finish with one last piece of advice. Over 19 years of investing, my  most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading  and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment  by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further  propagated by \"experts\" tweeting and commenting with their hidden  agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual  published results, but apparently, her opinion counts? Comments of her  blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical  vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, \"oh, he sounds  smart, so he must be right.\" or \"That sounds complicated, he must be on  to something.\" In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical  details are fooling many. DFV saw something well before masses, and he  was paid handsomely for it.\n\nIf my  opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen,  then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in  with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs.  a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.\n\nI am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD before making any decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 1}]}

He drew up the company\u2019s concept in a term paper at Yale, in which he called for a system specifically designed for urgent deliveries. Today, FedEx has a global presence and a market cap of $65 billion.\n\n\\- Salesforce was started in 1999 by former\u00a0Oracle\u00a0executive\u00a0Marc Benioff, who ultimately helped develop the incipient concepts of cloud computing, CRM, and software-as-a-service into the well-developed ideas they are in the 2020s. That company is worth nearly $250 billion today.\n\n\\- Jensen Huang founded Nvidia in 1993 with a belief that the next wave of computing would be graphics-based because it could solve problems that general-purpose computing could not. Today, the Nvidia is valued at a whopping $555 billion.\n\nWhat ground-floor opportunity might give us the next legendary success story and life-changing returns? In the 2020\u2019s, investors should look to the plant-based foods industry for hyper-growth.\n\nBelieve it or not, the market for plant-based meat is forecast to grow to $450 billion, and to make up a quarter of the $1.8 trillion meat market by 2040, according to consulting firm Kearney, which also sees animal protein peaking in 2025 (source: Bloomberg News, 5/3/21).

An investment\u2019s ESG score measures the sustainability of an investment in three specific categories: environmental, social and corporate governance.\n\nInvestors interested in environmental, social and governance issues often cite climate concerns as guiding their ESG investments.\n\nThey were rewarded during the market crash as oil prices cratered. In the first quarter, sustainability-focused funds held up better than the broader fund market during the initial bear market sell-off \u2013 driven in part by less exposure to fossil fuel energy.\n\nThat said, ESG goes beyond not buying petroleum companies; there's the \"S\" and the \"G\" parts, too, and those may take greater prominence as people focus on health care amid the pandemic and the social unrest triggered by systemic racism.\n\nThe global sustainable fund universe attracted $45.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020, versus an outflow of $384.7 billion from the overall fund universe. In the U.S. specifically, the research firm found that in the first quarter, flows into open-end and sustainable ETFs reached $10.5 billion, eclipsing the previous record set in 2019's fourth quarter.\n\nA June survey in 2020 from global investment manager Nuveen showed high-net-worth investors are starting to choose ESG for its outperformance, in addition to having a positive social impact, with 53% of respondents citing returns as their top reason to invest in ESG.\n\nAs such, it seems to be a wise choice to get started on an ESG portfolio. Here are some picks to get you started.\n\n***Coca-Cola (KO)***\n\nAs a mega-cap stock with a current market value around $250 billion, Coca-Cola has already partially recovered from the loss in sales due to the pandemic. Analysts suggest that by providing a dividend yield of approximately 3.1%, Coca-Cola makes the list of the top recovery stocks of 2021.\n\nMoreover, if you\u2019re looking for companies that strictly adhere to ESG policies, Coca-Cola has an AA rating from MSCI. The company performs exceptionally well when it comes to waste management, ensuring health and safety standards, and controlling the carbon footprint per product.\n\nThese attributes make it one of the leading ESG dividend stock companies in the beverage industry. Interestingly, only 15% have an AA rating from MSCI, while only 9% have a higher AAA rating.\n\n***Honeywell (HON)***\n\nHoneywell is an ESG-compliant company that shows high growth potential due to its share-price appreciation.\n\nThe Street predicts around 11% annual average growth for the company in the next few years, with a strong \u2018Buy\u2019 rating. Honeywell has consistently raised its dividends since 2014, going up from 45 cents per share to 95 cents last year.\n\nAs far as ESG compliance is concerned, Honeywell holds an AA rating from MSCI. Offering a dividend yield of 1.6%, Honeywell maintains its ESG rating among 14% of its industry peers, having the AA rating.\n\n***NVIDIA (NVDA)***\n\nThis is a well-known company producing graphics and video processing cards, remained unaffected by the pandemic. Analysts suggest that the company is bound to face the most prominent growth rate in the tech sector, surpassing artificial intelligence and auto technology. On the ESG end, NVIDIA is highly rated because of its mineral policy and effective corporate governance. The company uses rare minerals to build its chips and cards; therefore, it has a stringent policy against unethical procurement and mining of these minerals.\n\n***Chr. Hansen (CHYHY)***\n\nThe Danish human nutrition giant Chr. Hansen ranks high in ESG compliance due to its sustainable practices regarding food security and waste management. The company mainly produces bacteria that help curb the extended use of harmful pesticides while increasing crop yield at the same time.\n\nMoreover, Chr. Hansen has successfully developed an accounting system according to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. This helps the company assess the impact of each product and display the metrics to investors.\n\nThese extra measures place Chr. Hansen in the first place on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations List.\n\n***MBH Corporation (MBHCF)***\n\nMBH is a holding company actively building a portfolio of profitable, earnings accretive, debt-free small to medium enterprises (SME) that are expected to have a higher-than-normal growth profile as part of a larger organization. The company's operating model leaves management of the acquired companies to operate autonomously and fully accountable to develop and grow their businesses. As part of a larger organization, the acquired companies and in turn, MBH get the benefits of both worlds. This small holding company may have just started out, but it is pumping out revenue steadily and healthily and pays a 2% dividend. MBH Corporation has won five stars for their ESG credentials, getting into the top 1% of the nearly 2,000 businesses in the Support the Goals database. They have achieved this level of commitment through their work with inequality and climate goals. Support the Goals encourages businesses to take responsibility and the organisation expects companies 'to demonstrate how you support the world\u2019s most important action plan'.\n\n***NextEra Energy (NEE)***\n\nNextEra is the largest electric utility by market cap. Over the last few decades, the company has been consistently reducing its emissions through increased renewable energy use. Its CO2 emissions are 55% less than those of an average US utility. NextEra has now set an ambitious goal of reducing CO2 emissions, by 2025, by 67% from its 2005 base levels. This goal effectively means that absolute CO2 emissions would go down by 40% even while NextEra\u2019s energy production would double during that time. To its credit, the company last year received a best-in-class preparedness assessment by S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 ESG Evaluation. NextEra has, essentially, received the highest ranking given by S&amp;P to a company within the utility sector.\n\n***Microsoft (MSFT)***\n\nMicrosoft has taken the lead in its commitment towards carbon mitigation by becoming the first company among its peers to target \u201ccarbon negative\u201d status by 2030. It has created a $1 billion fund to reduce emissions and start clearing carbon. This ambitious commitment is unprecedented and sets Microsoft apart from its entire sector. Microsoft received the highest ESG rating of AAA from MSCI ESG Research in September 2019.\n\n***Prologis (PLD)***\n\nPrologis is a logistics-focused REIT with multiple \u201cfirst company to\u2026\u201d accomplishments in the ESG space. Prologis is the first real estate company to issue green bonds. It is also the first real estate company to be awarded the WELL certification by the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI). Additionally, Prologis is the first logistics company to receive approved SBTs or \u201cScience-Based Targets\u201d necessary to meet the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement of 2015. The company ranks highly on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World list and on the Investor\u2019s Business Daily (IBD) 50 Best ESG Companies list."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 1}]}

Do not reply to the comment, just classify it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "ESG, or environmental, social and governance investing, is a way to build a more ethical portfolio. An investment\u2019s ESG score measures the sustainability of an investment in three specific categories: environmental, social and corporate governance.\n\nInvestors interested in environmental, social and governance issues often cite climate concerns as guiding their ESG investments.\n\nThey were rewarded during the market crash as oil prices cratered. In the first quarter, sustainability-focused funds held up better than the broader fund market during the initial bear market sell-off \u2013 driven in part by less exposure to fossil fuel energy.\n\nThat said, ESG goes beyond not buying petroleum companies; there's the \"S\" and the \"G\" parts, too, and those may take greater prominence as people focus on health care amid the pandemic and the social unrest triggered by systemic racism.\n\nThe global sustainable fund universe attracted $45.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020, versus an outflow of $384.7 billion from the overall fund universe. In the U.S. specifically, the research firm found that in the first quarter, flows into open-end and sustainable ETFs reached $10.5 billion, eclipsing the previous record set in 2019's fourth quarter.\n\nA June survey in 2020 from global investment manager Nuveen showed high-net-worth investors are starting to choose ESG for its outperformance, in addition to having a positive social impact, with 53% of respondents citing returns as their top reason to invest in ESG.\n\nAs such, it seems to be a wise choice to get started on an ESG portfolio. Here are some picks to get you started.\n\n***Coca-Cola (KO)***\n\nAs a mega-cap stock with a current market value around $250 billion, Coca-Cola has already partially recovered from the loss in sales due to the pandemic. Analysts suggest that by providing a dividend yield of approximately 3.1%, Coca-Cola makes the list of the top recovery stocks of 2021.\n\nMoreover, if you\u2019re looking for companies that strictly adhere to ESG policies, Coca-Cola has an AA rating from MSCI. The company performs exceptionally well when it comes to waste management, ensuring health and safety standards, and controlling the carbon footprint per product.\n\nThese attributes make it one of the leading ESG dividend stock companies in the beverage industry. Interestingly, only 15% have an AA rating from MSCI, while only 9% have a higher AAA rating.\n\n***Honeywell (HON)***\n\nHoneywell is an ESG-compliant company that shows high growth potential due to its share-price appreciation.\n\nThe Street predicts around 11% annual average growth for the company in the next few years, with a strong \u2018Buy\u2019 rating. Honeywell has consistently raised its dividends since 2014, going up from 45 cents per share to 95 cents last year.\n\nAs far as ESG compliance is concerned, Honeywell holds an AA rating from MSCI. Offering a dividend yield of 1.6%, Honeywell maintains its ESG rating among 14% of its industry peers, having the AA rating.\n\n***NVIDIA (NVDA)***\n\nThis is a well-known company producing graphics and video processing cards, remained unaffected by the pandemic. Analysts suggest that the company is bound to face the most prominent growth rate in the tech sector, surpassing artificial intelligence and auto technology. On the ESG end, NVIDIA is highly rated because of its mineral policy and effective corporate governance. The company uses rare minerals to build its chips and cards; therefore, it has a stringent policy against unethical procurement and mining of these minerals.\n\n***Chr. Hansen (CHYHY)***\n\nThe Danish human nutrition giant Chr. Hansen ranks high in ESG compliance due to its sustainable practices regarding food security and waste management. The company mainly produces bacteria that help curb the extended use of harmful pesticides while increasing crop yield at the same time.\n\nMoreover, Chr. Hansen has successfully developed an accounting system according to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. This helps the company assess the impact of each product and display the metrics to investors.\n\nThese extra measures place Chr. Hansen in the first place on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations List.\n\n***MBH Corporation (MBHCF)***\n\nMBH is a holding company actively building a portfolio of profitable, earnings accretive, debt-free small to medium enterprises (SME) that are expected to have a higher-than-normal growth profile as part of a larger organization. The company's operating model leaves management of the acquired companies to operate autonomously and fully accountable to develop and grow their businesses. As part of a larger organization, the acquired companies and in turn, MBH get the benefits of both worlds. This small holding company may have just started out, but it is pumping out revenue steadily and healthily and pays a 2% dividend. MBH Corporation has won five stars for their ESG credentials, getting into the top 1% of the nearly 2,000 businesses in the Support the Goals database. They have achieved this level of commitment through their work with inequality and climate goals. Support the Goals encourages businesses to take responsibility and the organisation expects companies 'to demonstrate how you support the world\u2019s most important action plan'.\n\n***NextEra Energy (NEE)***\n\nNextEra is the largest electric utility by market cap. Over the last few decades, the company has been consistently reducing its emissions through increased renewable energy use. Its CO2 emissions are 55% less than those of an average US utility. NextEra has now set an ambitious goal of reducing CO2 emissions, by 2025, by 67% from its 2005 base levels. This goal effectively means that absolute CO2 emissions would go down by 40% even while NextEra\u2019s energy production would double during that time. To its credit, the company last year received a best-in-class preparedness assessment by S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 ESG Evaluation. NextEra has, essentially, received the highest ranking given by S&amp;P to a company within the utility sector.\n\n***Microsoft (MSFT)***\n\nMicrosoft has taken the lead in its commitment towards carbon mitigation by becoming the first company among its peers to target \u201ccarbon negative\u201d status by 2030. It has created a $1 billion fund to reduce emissions and start clearing carbon. This ambitious commitment is unprecedented and sets Microsoft apart from its entire sector. Microsoft received the highest ESG rating of AAA from MSCI ESG Research in September 2019.\n\n***Prologis (PLD)***\n\nPrologis is a logistics-focused REIT with multiple \u201cfirst company to\u2026\u201d accomplishments in the ESG space. Prologis is the first real estate company to issue green bonds. It is also the first real estate company to be awarded the WELL certification by the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI). Additionally, Prologis is the first logistics company to receive approved SBTs or \u201cScience-Based Targets\u201d necessary to meet the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement of 2015. The company ranks highly on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World list and on the Investor\u2019s Business Daily (IBD) 50 Best ESG Companies list."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 1}]}

Im about to present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to 75x your  money\\*\\*.\\*\\* Too much, or too good to be true? Im being conservative. Hear  me out.\n\n**First, I shall Flex:**\n\n1. I  am an MD and a Professor. To spell out the obvious, I have insight into  what matters in the medical world. Many pure researchers lack this  (cough cough Elisabeth Bik). In addition, As medical school faculty, If I  can't figure it out, I know who to ask.\n2. I started investing (profitably) before most of you were born.\n\nWhy  flex? To make it abundantly clear, my opinion on biotech investing  matters just a little. With that said, once more, listen up!\n\n**The Pickle:**\n\nYou  youngins haven't noticed, but Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of  death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. The kicker is,  there is NO effective treatment.\n\nThe  FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm. This drug has  significant adverse events. The risk of brain swelling requires serial  Brain MRIs. It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV  infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k. Most incredible is  that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate  trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make  later).\n\nAgain, for emphasis, the  FDA still approved it because the need is that severe. President Biden  recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation  over a trillion dollars.\n\n**The Fix: $SAVA**\n\nCassava  Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive  function in its CMS trial. The degree and duration of improvement have  NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic.  It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that  behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it  doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the  discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.\n\nYes,  we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc. A genuine  criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased  critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the  usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives  conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the  ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.\n\nWithout  getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere  criticisms is Phase 3 trials. There is no valid argument against this  statement. This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use  absolute phrases. If you take away only one point from this article,  then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start  early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more  about him later). Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after  the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also  threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy. Be angry,  fellow apes, be angry. Im just getting started, BTW.\n\nDo  market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal?  They do. That is why the stock price went from &lt; $1 to an ATH of  $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my  family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the  first place.\n\n**The Villan and His Massacre:**\n\nJordan  Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a \"Citizens Petition.\"  A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit)  out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical  to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed  another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.\n\nEssentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second,  sold their shares. SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the  making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog ([https://ad-science.org/](https://ad-science.org/)),  Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it  biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.\n\n1. Jordan  Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that  patients are literally dying as they wait. WTF!? Why, why why?? If you  aren't angry, somethings wrong with you. JT states he is concerned for  patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there  is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected,  JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly.  In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did  JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that  is the \\*only\\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is  safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall  continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these  petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is  horrendous (3% success rate)? Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who  uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD  in its purest form.\n2. Then  why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous  document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe  even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my  position by 30%. With that said, Im not surprised the masses started  selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent,  it's an \\*opportunity\\*\u2014a second chance to buy the stock on clearance.\n\n**The Financials:**\n\n$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue.\n\nFifty  million patients are suffering from AD globally. 6 million of those  patients reside in the US. Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American  market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs  $20k annually, just a bit over a third the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's  soon to fail drug):\n\n1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000\n\nThat  calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up  as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment  options). The current stock price is $50. The overly conservative  valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750\n\nThe above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia.\n\n**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**\n\nIf  you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading  causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a  hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of  death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment.  Thats devastating for patients, but families? It's not uncommon for  families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they \"can't  handle it anymore.\" This market is massive and unaddressed! Severely,  painfully, and gravely unaddressed.\n\nI  have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires  (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process. JT is only the  face of this farce. Behind him are many short positions making a 100  million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their  short-term gain. There is something far more concerning.\n\n**The Plot Thickens:**\n\nWhat  I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or  short-term price action. There is something much more sinister. Biogen  has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved. Now it  is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a  problem:\n\nFDA advisory committee  voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then  saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently,  a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and  Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to  support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and  Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the  country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's  AD drug. This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you  to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no  other therapy on the market. Well, what happens if a new, more effective  medication shows up?\n\n**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**\n\nBack  to our Villian JT. JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the  initial \"Citizens Patetion\") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works. Why? I  speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous  whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried  about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in  profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is  more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer. There is  little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less. When that  happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug. Biogen already  has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to  rejuvenate the companies earnings. Then expediently and as expected,  Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.\n\nI  believe that is the root issue. Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become  furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam! A group of us have  gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to  investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).\n\n**Short term price action:**\n\n1. Im  expecting the SP to bounce. After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a  perfect overreaction play. If you dont know what Im talking about, you  can look up \"overreaction with reversion to the mean.\"\n2. Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within \"weeks to months.\"\n3. Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks. (\"Soon\" per Remi)\n4. Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.\n\n\\#SAVA's  float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted  with utilization of &gt;90%. It'll take very little to make SAVA move,  big. Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.\n\nI  have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on  SAVA. My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!). I'll  finish with one last piece of advice. Over 19 years of investing, my  most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading  and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment  by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further  propagated by \"experts\" tweeting and commenting with their hidden  agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual  published results, but apparently, her opinion counts? Comments of her  blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical  vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, \"oh, he sounds  smart, so he must be right.\" or \"That sounds complicated, he must be on  to something.\" In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical  details are fooling many. DFV saw something well before masses, and he  was paid handsomely for it.\n\nIf my  opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen,  then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in  with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs.  a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.\n\nI am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD before making any decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": -1}]}

A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, as the name implies, is a denial of service (DoS) attack that originates from multiple sources simultaneously. A DoS attack is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. This is accomplished by flooding the target with traffic, or sending it information that triggers a crash making the targeted system unresponsive.\n\nThe most common DoS attacks are Buffer Overflow attacks - sending more traffic to a network address than the programmers have bult the system to handle. It includes most attack types, in addition to others that are designed to exploit bugs specific to certain applications or networks. By saturating a targeted server with an overwhelming amount of packets, a malicious actor is able to oversaturate server capacity, resulting in denial-of-service. In order for most DoS flood attacks to be successful, the malicious actor must have more available bandwidth than the target. An attack type in which a memory buffer overflow can cause a machine to consume all available hard disk space, memory, or CPU time. This form of exploit often results in sluggish behavior, system crashes, or other deleterious server behaviors, resulting in denial-of-service.\n\nIn the early days of the Internet, websites would exist on individual hosts, and single-source DoS attacks could be effective. Today, this is much less likely; sites are hosted on the cloud and/or across multiple data centers, integrated with CDNs, and so on. Even using techniques such as amplification and reflection, it is very difficult for a single-source attack to have enough bandwidth to overwhelm a modern site\u2019s resources.\n\n**Why it\u2019s hard to defend against DDoS attacks**\n\nModern security technologies have developed mechanisms to defend against most forms of DoS attacks, but due to the unique characteristics of DDoS, it is still regarded as an elevated threat and is of higher concern to organizations that fear being targeted by such an attack. DDoS attack occurs when multiple systems orchestrate a synchronized DoS attack to a single target. The essential difference is that instead of being attacked from one location, the target is attacked from many locations at once.\n\n**Companies Developing DDoS Solutions for the Financial Sector**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve unpacked what a DDoS attack is and why banks/fintech companies are such a prime target, lets take a look at some of the players developing cutting-edge solutions for future protection:\n\n**CloudFlare (NYSE: NET)** is a leader in the field of web architecture/security with a specialty on DDoS mitigation. The firm went public in September 2019 at a share price of $18. Its stock price has steadily climbed since the IPO, continuing its uptick at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as consumers and companies increasingly turned online. According to recent reviews by both IDC MarketSpace and Forrester, CloudFare has been recognized as an innovator in the field of DDoS prevention and mitigation. CloudFare offers one of the most comprehensive DDoS prevention toolkits on the market, and it is compatible with web applications, network infrastructure, and the IoT. NET is a pretty solid tech investment pick, with a consensus rating of BUY and an average target price of $205 (up from $137). In other words, this is an established player in the cyber solutions market with a reputation that precedes itself and forecasts for strong upside moving into 2022.\n\n**RadWare (NASDAQ: RDWR)** is another household name in the world of net/data security. This Israeli-American company has created a niche for itself in the space of cyber security and application delivery solutions for applications in physical, virtual, cloud, and software defined data centers worldwide. One of their flagship products is DefensePro, which provides automated DDoS protection from fast-moving, high-volume, encrypted or very-short-duration threats. RadWare has been workin with leading players in the financial services and banking industries for nearly a decade, and its DefensePro is considered a \u201cgold standard\u201d for anti-DDoS solutions. Notwithstanding a recent downgrade from overperforming to performing by Oppenheimer, RDWR holds a BUY consensus after gaining nearly 30% in share value over the past month alone. Definitely another DDoS prevention provider to keep tabs on.\n\n**HUB Security (TASE: HUB)** is an Israeli player that has surged in 2021. From their merger with ALD in February to their $22M acquisition of ComSec global in September to their recent declaration of intent for a NASDAQ listing, HUB is fast becoming a disruptor in the confidential computing field. They recently clinched deals with three European national banks for a DDoS simulation platform designed to up readiness and defensive protocol. More specifically, their D.Storm product is a system that collects data from the bot attacks in real-time and presents it to the user for in-depth analysis. In essence, D.Storm provides actionable intelligence to banks and fintech actors that they need to manage the risks in the face of an increasingly sophisticated threat landscape. Though listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, HUB is on my watchlist for the anticipated NASDAQ listing and the significant value-multiplier it will entail for HUB\u2019s enterprise value.\n\nThis went on a bit longer than expected, but I hope readers who made it to the bottom have a better idea of what a DDoS attack is, why they are particularly worrisome for the financial services sector, and who some of the big names working on mitigation solutions are. I\u2019m a tech investor and not a financial advisor, so DYOR. And Happy New Years kiddos, stay warm and wear a mask."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 0}]}

(\u201cSCV\u201d) announces the availability of a new interview with Nika Jaksic, COO of BioLife Sciences Inc. (OTCPK: BLFE) (the \u201cCompany\u201d), to provide an overview of the Company\u2019s operations and corporate momentum. The interview includes discussion on BioLife\u2019s plans for uplitsing and its upcoming launch of an innovative product to improve cannabis cultivation.\n\nThe full interview can be heard at: [https://www.smallcapvoice.com/july-2022-interview-biolife-sciences-blfe/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=u7ZzQIAERFByvvGw_0I7ukrTa8NBLgZYDNz9CGq4SiMFkgf3Nob4jg5a05Ohfu9D7eK_nz95IWYHZZB8rphVZQHsND20UrGtV3OkgGpm8_SOMj9poOByysP05IFRIum3NJlslUEhRX2wJqRjKahlrM3Z8ZV7N_frUAj1Drlq1UTI2WfYJudoEvJQcJq6OLONzmcqxWVfcPbA93m8mUhz7Ex0y94ttTBa_vUJFEcYIOs=).\n\nBioLife is a commercialization accelerator focused on moving innovative products from the lab to small scale production while also conceptualizing and innovating its own line of products. Speaking with SCV\u2019s Stuart Smith, Jaksic explains how the Company\u2019s wide approach to this model creates unrestrictive market opportunity.\n\n\u201cWe like to take disruptive ideas and grow and expand those ideas into marketable products that aim to enrich the lives of our customers and our communities, whether that's a new concept being developed from scratch, or simply us reinventing the wheel,\u201d he says. \u201cWe're not going to limit ourselves to any one product or any one industry. If we have a marketable idea that will help our customers and benefit our shareholders, then we will pursue.\u201d\n\nJaksic next describes how a corporate transformation, brought on by a leadership change in 2020, has enhanced business development. This growth includes an acquisition strategy that enables the introduction of new and innovative products to the market. As the Company advances on these opportunities, it is now prepared to broaden its exposure to the investment community.\n\n\u201cUplisting to the OTCQB has traditionally resulted in greater liquidity, increased transparency, upgraded reporting standards, better overall awareness of the company to our larger group of investors, including venture capitalists,\u201d he says. \u201cAside from that, we are going to continue developing our new natural health products division so we can keep expanding our company and its offerings in the coming years. And of course, we're going to introduce new and exciting products to the marketplace so we can increase the Company's revenue. We're excited about what the future holds for our Company and its shareholders.\u201d\n\nA high-potential aspect of BioLife\u2019s future pivots from its acquisition of Health Box LLC, a health products company founded by Jaksic in 2020, along with a new focus on copper-infused textiles.\n\n\u201cWhen I say we \u2018reinvent the wheel,\u2019 that is exactly what we accomplished with our copper infusion process and the resulting line of product,\u201d Jaksic says, explaining how the COVID-19 pandemic generated greater demand for products utilizing copper\u2019s antimicrobial properties. While there are many copper-infused textiles in the market, BioLife distanced itself from competitors by offering superior and innovative copper-infused textiles.\n\nThe root innovation is the Company\u2019s unique copper infusion process, which significantly improves copper distribution throughout the fibers of the fabric while reducing costs and time.\n\n\u201cWe can use infusion in the traditional way to design our copper-infused garments from scratch \u2026 or we can do it by obtaining preexisting garments and infusing them with copper after they have been designed,\u201d Jaksic says. This capability enables BioLife to pursue partnerships with other companies that want to improve the quality and efficacy of their products beyond industry standards.\n\nBased on this technology, the Company intends to initiate three novel product launches within the next year, starting with an antimicrobial copper-infused fabric gardening pot. This product launch will position the Company before a new market of customers in the $300+ billion global cannabis cultivation market.\n\n\u201cThe copper works as a fungicide that eliminates harmful microbes while simultaneously boosting the beneficial organisms that thrive in the soil. The results are healthier and stronger plants with larger yields as well as healthier soil,\u201d Jaksic explains. \u201cOur main target demographic will be cannabis cultivators due to the unique growing requirements of cannabis. Cannabis farmers are keenly aware of the benefits of fabric pots. We will vigorously pursue the cannabis cultivator market, but we will additionally focus on farmers, agricultural professionals, home gardeners, landscapers, nurseries and some industrial gardening organizations.\u201d\n\nTo hear the full interview with SCV, visit: [https://www.smallcapvoice.com/july-2022-interview-biolife-sciences-blfe/](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=u7ZzQIAERFByvvGw_0I7ukrTa8NBLgZYDNz9CGq4SiMFkgf3Nob4jg5a05Ohfu9D7eK_nz95IWYHZZB8rphVZQHsND20UrGtV3OkgGpm8_RSAAALstmhSyvjqyian8G-CKvh9S97pA7rLcYrLhDLOpwPMEPVzP8CP4SacH2b_RrW_8OCTaObLkDFEi2sku1tEU5IbLKPKxKIK6axhq6dEYrd6Jke5DBCkzV52FtiemY=).\n\n**About BioLife Sciences Inc.**\n\nBioLife Sciences Inc. specializes in moving innovative products from the lab or small-scale production into wider market adoption.

It\u2019s simple: the vast majority of retail traders are latecomers to trends. They follow the crowds instead of leading \u2013 they try to get in on the tail end of a movement instead of getting in on the ground floor of an opportunity.\n\nThe key to powerful, sustained returns in stocks is to catch a trend in the early stages. The best among these are founder-led companies \u2013 and when you pick the right ones, the gains could potentially be in the thousands of percentage points:\n\n\\- Apple\u00a0was co-founded by Steve Jobs in 1976. Apple stock has yielded returns of roughly 376,000% since 1981. From 1997 to now, we're talking about 2,000x one\u2019s initial investment.\n\n\\- Jeff Bezos founded Amazon from his garage in\u00a0Bellevue, Washington, on July 5, 1994. Amazon stock shares have gained an astounding 200,000% since the company\u2019s IPO.\n\n\\- FedEx was founded in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1971 by\u00a0Yale University student Frederick W. Smith. He drew up the company\u2019s concept in a term paper at Yale, in which he called for a system specifically designed for urgent deliveries. Today, FedEx has a global presence and a market cap of $65 billion.\n\n\\- Salesforce was started in 1999 by former\u00a0Oracle\u00a0executive\u00a0Marc Benioff, who ultimately helped develop the incipient concepts of cloud computing, CRM, and software-as-a-service into the well-developed ideas they are in the 2020s. That company is worth nearly $250 billion today.\n\n\\- Jensen Huang founded Nvidia in 1993 with a belief that the next wave of computing would be graphics-based because it could solve problems that general-purpose computing could not. Today, the Nvidia is valued at a whopping $555 billion.\n\nWhat ground-floor opportunity might give us the next legendary success story and life-changing returns? In the 2020\u2019s, investors should look to the plant-based foods industry for hyper-growth.\n\nBelieve it or not, the market for plant-based meat is forecast to grow to $450 billion, and to make up a quarter of the $1.8 trillion meat market by 2040, according to consulting firm Kearney, which also sees animal protein peaking in 2025 (source: Bloomberg News, 5/3/21).

However, even seasoned investors can find some use out of this by getting back to the basics. This quick guide isn't meant to focus on financial metrics, but in an effort to explore companies based on the world around us.\n\nPreface: This is directed for individuals that are just starting to invest, in hopes of empowering them to continue to grow upon the knowledge they learn on in this post! This is also a post to help highlight a new social investing platform I've been building called [Mainstreet](https://mainstreetportfolio.com/) (currently in beta) that helps you invest with your friends, track your portfolios, and build communities with one another. Happy investing!\n\n**How To Find Stocks (for the Normal Investor)**\n\nOne of the most common questions I get when talking to someone just getting into investing, is something along the lines of \u201cWhich stocks are good?\u201d or \u201cHow do I find stocks to invest in?\u201d. Some of the reasons individuals choose not to invest is due to the \u201clack of knowledge\u201d or perhaps they are \u201cintimidated by the market\u201d. These are all valid reasons to not invest, but I feel like by providing the education and resources to learn about these topics in an easy and digestible manner will help people overcome these barriers and feel empowered to take control of their wealth, whether it\u2019s through real estate, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll dive into some of the strategies and methods I used to help gain knowledge and insight when investing in the stock market. Keep in mind this is not the definitive guide, but it\u2019s steps that I took to help me become more financially literate about the stock market. Everyone\u2019s path to financial education is different and unique and this is only meant to provide a different perspective for someone just starting out.\n\n**Pay Attention to the World Around You**\n\nThe first thing I usually tell people is, start to observe the world around you and the businesses that are close to your network. You\u2019ll easily be able to find many companies if you start to shift your mindset and look at how the world functions.\n\nFirst, look at what kind of products or services you consume. Do you need to get your fix of vanilla latte at Starbucks ($SBUX) in the morning? More of a fast food person? Let\u2019s look at McDonalds ($MCD), Chipotle ($CMG), Shake Shack ($SHAK), or Restaurant Brands International ($QSR). Are you a hardcore gamer? Well, I\u2019m sure one of your games or consoles comes from Sony ($SNE), Nintendo ($NTDOY), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), or Microsoft ($MSFT). Or maybe you\u2019ve been working from home? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had to buy some products from Amazon ($AMZN) or Wayfair ($W) to spruce up your office space. You\u2019re probably also using things like Zoom ($ZM), Google Drive ($GOOG or $GOOGL), or Slack to keep yourself productive during the day.\n\n**Build a Watchlist**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got the brain working a little, it\u2019s important to start building a watchlist of all the stocks you\u2019ve thought of. You can use your broker watchlist tool, or even an app like Yahoo Finance, WeBull, etc. Sort them in a way that works for you, whether it\u2019s by sector (financial, tech, industrials), subsector (gaming, oil, e-commerce), or even by priority (Watchlist Tier 1, Watchlist Tier 2, etc.)\n\nOrganization is key when building your watchlist. You\u2019ll want to have them organized because it\u2019ll help you get a quick glance of what\u2019s happening in the market at any given time. By checking on the stocks you\u2019ve added to your watchlist periodically, you\u2019ll learn how they move according to catalysts (market news, earnings, etc) and be able to plan how and when you\u2019d like to invest in them.\n\n**Search within an Index Fund or ETF**\n\nA great way to search up companies is by looking at current index fund or ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) allocations. With index funds, you can look at the holdings of the S&amp;P500 (Top 500 American companies) or the Nasdaq 100 (Most active, largest 100 Nasdaq companies). At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of the S&amp;P500 are:\n\n1. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)\n2. Microsoft Corp ($MSFT)\n3. Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN)\n4. Facebook, Inc. ($FB)\n5. Alphabet Inc. Class A ($GOOGL)\n6. Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG)\n7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc ($BRK.B)\n8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ($JPM)\n9. Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA)\n10. Johnson &amp; Johnson ($JNJ)\n\nAnother way is to look into the holdings of an ETF. There are tons of ETFs out there that track indices like $SPY and $QQQ, which track the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, as well as more focused sector ETFs, like the ARK Innovation Fund ($ARKK) or the O\u2019Shares Global Internet Giants Fund ($OGIG).\n\nOne of my favorites is ARKK, as they focus on disruptive innovation and change. So, for example, if something like this was to resonate with you, looking into their top holdings will give you some insight on what kinds of companies you\u2019d need to do research on to gain exposure to this particular strategy. At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of ARKK are:\n\n1. Tesla, Inc ($TSLA)\n2. Teladoc Health, Inc. ($TDOC)\n3. Roku, Inc. ($ROKU)\n4. Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)\n5. Square, Inc. ($SQ)\n6. Shopify, Inc ($SHOP)\n7. Spotify Technology SA ($SPOT)\n8. Twilio, Inc (TWLO)\n9. Coinbase Global, Inc ($COIN)\n10. Unity Software, Inc ($U)\n\nHopefully looking into index funds or ETFs like the ones listed above help spark curiosity and the urge to build on your own knowledge!\n\n**Invest in Things You Understand (Personal, Business)**\n\nAnother piece of advice I like to give people is to only invest in areas of the market you understand. For example, if I see a sector like biotech or cybersecurity shoot up 50% in the last three months, but I don\u2019t really understand how this industry works, don\u2019t put your money in it. Simple as that. If the whole stock market started to fall, these will be the easiest to target as a potential sell because you don\u2019t understand the industry or the company at all. Your conviction on the stock is low so incentive to hold onto it for the long term is also low.\n\nFor me, I\u2019m a big gamer and I understand the industry well. To compare it to the previous example above, I can take those companies and further extrapolate to build upon my research using my existing knowledge. As a result, I\u2019m aware that gaming consoles use chips from Intel ($INTC), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), as well as GPU processors from Nvidia ($NVDA). Many video games are developed on software applications like Unity ($U). I\u2019m also aware that a large population of gamers and gaming companies come from Asia and Europe, therefore I can look into stocks like Ubisoft ($UBI), Capcom ($CCOEF), or even Tencent Holdings ($TCEHY). What about gaming accessories from Corsair ($CRSR) or Logitech ($LOGI)? And let\u2019s not forget about Gamestop ($GME)!\n\nAnother great way to leverage your knowledge is to look at your workplace and how the business is structured from within. Does your company utilize products or services from other companies? If you work at a software company, perhaps you use Cisco ($CSCO) or Ciena ($CIEN) for your networking. If your company uses customer or sales support, you may be using something like Salesforce ($CRM), Twilio ($TWLO), or Zendesk ($ZEN). To optimize your business, your company may also be leveraging cybersecurity services like Palo Alto ($PALO), Okta ($OKTA), or Crowdstrike ($CRWD). By looking within your own workplace, you\u2019ll be able to do a bit of deeper digging to find stocks that services businesses and aren\u2019t as customer facing.\n\nUnderstanding an industry well allows you to build your conviction in that industry. By fully grasping the ins and outs, you\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re invested in. This prevents panicking or selling if you suddenly see a red day, because you know what the company is fundamentally and potentially capable of. It also allows you to get invested in the companies you\u2019re buying, ultimately feeling like a small owner of the company, which is exactly what the function of stocks are.\n\n**Diversify your Portfolio**\n\nSo now, you\u2019ve done a bit of research and found a ton of stocks you might potentially invest in. Now what? Well, now is where you want to think about risk management and portfolio diversity.\n\nFrom Investopedia, diversification is a \u201crisk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\u201d\n\nHow do I know what\u2019s diversified enough? Great question, but that\u2019s up to your personal risk tolerance. Try not to allocate all your stocks into one single sector or area of the market. By broadening out in sector (tech, industrial), subsector (5G, banks), geography (US, Asia, Europe), market cap (large, medium, small), and more, you can feel comfortable and confident with your investments. The last thing you want to be doing is checking your stocks every minute and wondering if you should buy more or sell it off. Also consider the timeline of your allocations. The majority of my portfolio is in long-term investments (3+ years), but I do have a small portion of my portfolio allocated to mid-term and momentum investments (less than two years), such as options and swing trading. It\u2019s up to each individual investor to determine these allocations and stay committed to knowing when to change your allocation based on your time horizon.\n\nConsider this portfolio of $10000 dollars: (Stock, dollar amount\\[%\\], sector/subsector/geography/market cap)\n\n* Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA - $1000 (10%) - Tech / EV / USA / Large\n* Alibaba Group ($BABA) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / E-Commerce / ASIA / Large\n* Bank of America ($BAC) - $1000 (10%) - Financials / Banking / USA / Large\n* GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Pharma / EU / Large\n* Brookfield Renewable ($BEP)- $1000 (10%) - Energy / Renewable / CAN / Large\n* Papa John\u2019s Int. ($PZZA)- $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Consumer/ USA / Mid\n* Ubisoft Entertainment ($UBI) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / Gaming / EU / Mid\n* Barrick Gold ($GOLD) - $1000 (10%) - Industrials / Mining / CAN / Mid\n* Aurora Cannabis ($ACB) - $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Cannabis / CAN / Small\n* Nano-X Imaging ($NNOX) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Telehealth / Israel / Small\n\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve been able to allocate into many different sectors, subsectors, geographies, and market caps. If one of these companies were to disappear tomorrow, we\u2019d still have 90% of our portfolio remaining.\n\nOf our mock portfolio, our sector allocation is the following: 30% Technology, 20% Consumer, 20% Health, and 10% each in Financials, Energy, and Industrials. Our subsector allocation is fully diversified in 10 subsectors of the market: Electric Vehicles, E-Commerce, Banking, Pharma, Renewable Energy, Consumer, Gaming, Mining, Cannabis, and Telehealth. In terms of geography, our allocation is the following: 30% USA, 30% Canada, 20% Europe, 10% Asia, and 10% Israel. With our market cap, our allocation is the following: 50% large, 30% mid, and 20% small. As you can see, this portfolio is well diversified in terms of sector, subsector, region, and market cap. These allocations will ultimately be up to you, as you will be in control of your portfolio.\n\n**Now You\u2019re Ready!**\n\nAnd that\u2019s it, we\u2019ve learned how to find stocks by looking at your surroundings using your own knowledge from your personal and work life and now you understand how to properly diversify a portfolio based on your own risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\n**Mainstreet**\n\nThis article is part of a series of articles aimed at assisting investors to take control of their wealth on Mainstreet.

Im about to present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to 75x your  money\\*\\*.\\*\\* Too much, or too good to be true? Im being conservative. Hear  me out.\n\n**First, I shall Flex:**\n\n1. I  am an MD and a Professor. To spell out the obvious, I have insight into  what matters in the medical world. Many pure researchers lack this  (cough cough Elisabeth Bik). In addition, As medical school faculty, If I  can't figure it out, I know who to ask.\n2. I started investing (profitably) before most of you were born.\n\nWhy  flex? To make it abundantly clear, my opinion on biotech investing  matters just a little. With that said, once more, listen up!\n\n**The Pickle:**\n\nYou  youngins haven't noticed, but Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of  death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. The kicker is,  there is NO effective treatment.\n\nThe  FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm. This drug has  significant adverse events. The risk of brain swelling requires serial  Brain MRIs. It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV  infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k. Most incredible is  that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate  trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make  later).\n\nAgain, for emphasis, the  FDA still approved it because the need is that severe. President Biden  recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation  over a trillion dollars.\n\n**The Fix: $SAVA**\n\nCassava  Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive  function in its CMS trial. The degree and duration of improvement have  NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic.  It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that  behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it  doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the  discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.\n\nYes,  we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc. A genuine  criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased  critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the  usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives  conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the  ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.\n\nWithout  getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere  criticisms is Phase 3 trials. There is no valid argument against this  statement. This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use  absolute phrases. If you take away only one point from this article,  then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start  early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more  about him later). Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after  the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also  threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy. Be angry,  fellow apes, be angry. Im just getting started, BTW.\n\nDo  market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal?  They do. That is why the stock price went from &lt; $1 to an ATH of  $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my  family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the  first place.\n\n**The Villan and His Massacre:**\n\nJordan  Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a \"Citizens Petition.\"  A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit)  out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical  to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed  another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.\n\nEssentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second,  sold their shares. SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the  making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog ([https://ad-science.org/](https://ad-science.org/)),  Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it  biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.\n\n1. Jordan  Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that  patients are literally dying as they wait. WTF!? Why, why why?? If you  aren't angry, somethings wrong with you. JT states he is concerned for  patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there  is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected,  JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly.  In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did  JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that  is the \\*only\\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is  safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall  continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these  petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is  horrendous (3% success rate)? Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who  uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD  in its purest form.\n2. Then  why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous  document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe  even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my  position by 30%. With that said, Im not surprised the masses started  selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent,  it's an \\*opportunity\\*\u2014a second chance to buy the stock on clearance.\n\n**The Financials:**\n\n$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue.\n\nFifty  million patients are suffering from AD globally. 6 million of those  patients reside in the US. Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American  market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs  $20k annually, just a bit over a third the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's  soon to fail drug):\n\n1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000\n\nThat  calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up  as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment  options). The current stock price is $50. The overly conservative  valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750\n\nThe above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia.\n\n**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**\n\nIf  you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading  causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a  hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of  death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment.  Thats devastating for patients, but families? It's not uncommon for  families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they \"can't  handle it anymore.\" This market is massive and unaddressed! Severely,  painfully, and gravely unaddressed.\n\nI  have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires  (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process. JT is only the  face of this farce. Behind him are many short positions making a 100  million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their  short-term gain. There is something far more concerning.\n\n**The Plot Thickens:**\n\nWhat  I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or  short-term price action. There is something much more sinister. Biogen  has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved. Now it  is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a  problem:\n\nFDA advisory committee  voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then  saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently,  a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and  Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to  support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and  Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the  country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's  AD drug. This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you  to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no  other therapy on the market. Well, what happens if a new, more effective  medication shows up?\n\n**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**\n\nBack  to our Villian JT. JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the  initial \"Citizens Patetion\") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works. Why? I  speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous  whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried  about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in  profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is  more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer. There is  little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less. When that  happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug. Biogen already  has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to  rejuvenate the companies earnings. Then expediently and as expected,  Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.\n\nI  believe that is the root issue. Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become  furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam! A group of us have  gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to  investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).\n\n**Short term price action:**\n\n1. Im  expecting the SP to bounce. After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a  perfect overreaction play. If you dont know what Im talking about, you  can look up \"overreaction with reversion to the mean.\"\n2. Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within \"weeks to months.\"\n3. Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks. (\"Soon\" per Remi)\n4. Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.\n\n\\#SAVA's  float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted  with utilization of &gt;90%. It'll take very little to make SAVA move,  big. Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.\n\nI  have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on  SAVA. My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!). I'll  finish with one last piece of advice. Over 19 years of investing, my  most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading  and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment  by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further  propagated by \"experts\" tweeting and commenting with their hidden  agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual  published results, but apparently, her opinion counts? Comments of her  blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical  vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, \"oh, he sounds  smart, so he must be right.\" or \"That sounds complicated, he must be on  to something.\" In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical  details are fooling many. DFV saw something well before masses, and he  was paid handsomely for it.\n\nIf my  opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen,  then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in  with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs.  a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.\n\nI am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD before making any decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 1}]}

An investment\u2019s ESG score measures the sustainability of an investment in three specific categories: environmental, social and corporate governance.\n\nInvestors interested in environmental, social and governance issues often cite climate concerns as guiding their ESG investments.\n\nThey were rewarded during the market crash as oil prices cratered. In the first quarter, sustainability-focused funds held up better than the broader fund market during the initial bear market sell-off \u2013 driven in part by less exposure to fossil fuel energy.\n\nThat said, ESG goes beyond not buying petroleum companies; there's the \"S\" and the \"G\" parts, too, and those may take greater prominence as people focus on health care amid the pandemic and the social unrest triggered by systemic racism.\n\nThe global sustainable fund universe attracted $45.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020, versus an outflow of $384.7 billion from the overall fund universe. In the U.S. specifically, the research firm found that in the first quarter, flows into open-end and sustainable ETFs reached $10.5 billion, eclipsing the previous record set in 2019's fourth quarter.\n\nA June survey in 2020 from global investment manager Nuveen showed high-net-worth investors are starting to choose ESG for its outperformance, in addition to having a positive social impact, with 53% of respondents citing returns as their top reason to invest in ESG.\n\nAs such, it seems to be a wise choice to get started on an ESG portfolio. Here are some picks to get you started.\n\n***Coca-Cola (KO)***\n\nAs a mega-cap stock with a current market value around $250 billion, Coca-Cola has already partially recovered from the loss in sales due to the pandemic. Analysts suggest that by providing a dividend yield of approximately 3.1%, Coca-Cola makes the list of the top recovery stocks of 2021.\n\nMoreover, if you\u2019re looking for companies that strictly adhere to ESG policies, Coca-Cola has an AA rating from MSCI. The company performs exceptionally well when it comes to waste management, ensuring health and safety standards, and controlling the carbon footprint per product.\n\nThese attributes make it one of the leading ESG dividend stock companies in the beverage industry. Interestingly, only 15% have an AA rating from MSCI, while only 9% have a higher AAA rating.\n\n***Honeywell (HON)***\n\nHoneywell is an ESG-compliant company that shows high growth potential due to its share-price appreciation.\n\nThe Street predicts around 11% annual average growth for the company in the next few years, with a strong \u2018Buy\u2019 rating. Honeywell has consistently raised its dividends since 2014, going up from 45 cents per share to 95 cents last year.\n\nAs far as ESG compliance is concerned, Honeywell holds an AA rating from MSCI. Offering a dividend yield of 1.6%, Honeywell maintains its ESG rating among 14% of its industry peers, having the AA rating.\n\n***NVIDIA (NVDA)***\n\nThis is a well-known company producing graphics and video processing cards, remained unaffected by the pandemic. Analysts suggest that the company is bound to face the most prominent growth rate in the tech sector, surpassing artificial intelligence and auto technology. On the ESG end, NVIDIA is highly rated because of its mineral policy and effective corporate governance. The company uses rare minerals to build its chips and cards; therefore, it has a stringent policy against unethical procurement and mining of these minerals.\n\n***Chr. Hansen (CHYHY)***\n\nThe Danish human nutrition giant Chr. Hansen ranks high in ESG compliance due to its sustainable practices regarding food security and waste management. The company mainly produces bacteria that help curb the extended use of harmful pesticides while increasing crop yield at the same time.\n\nMoreover, Chr. Hansen has successfully developed an accounting system according to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. This helps the company assess the impact of each product and display the metrics to investors.\n\nThese extra measures place Chr. Hansen in the first place on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations List.\n\n***MBH Corporation (MBHCF)***\n\nMBH is a holding company actively building a portfolio of profitable, earnings accretive, debt-free small to medium enterprises (SME) that are expected to have a higher-than-normal growth profile as part of a larger organization. The company's operating model leaves management of the acquired companies to operate autonomously and fully accountable to develop and grow their businesses. As part of a larger organization, the acquired companies and in turn, MBH get the benefits of both worlds. This small holding company may have just started out, but it is pumping out revenue steadily and healthily and pays a 2% dividend. MBH Corporation has won five stars for their ESG credentials, getting into the top 1% of the nearly 2,000 businesses in the Support the Goals database. They have achieved this level of commitment through their work with inequality and climate goals. Support the Goals encourages businesses to take responsibility and the organisation expects companies 'to demonstrate how you support the world\u2019s most important action plan'.\n\n***NextEra Energy (NEE)***\n\nNextEra is the largest electric utility by market cap. Over the last few decades, the company has been consistently reducing its emissions through increased renewable energy use. Its CO2 emissions are 55% less than those of an average US utility. NextEra has now set an ambitious goal of reducing CO2 emissions, by 2025, by 67% from its 2005 base levels. This goal effectively means that absolute CO2 emissions would go down by 40% even while NextEra\u2019s energy production would double during that time. To its credit, the company last year received a best-in-class preparedness assessment by S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 ESG Evaluation. NextEra has, essentially, received the highest ranking given by S&amp;P to a company within the utility sector.\n\n***Microsoft (MSFT)***\n\nMicrosoft has taken the lead in its commitment towards carbon mitigation by becoming the first company among its peers to target \u201ccarbon negative\u201d status by 2030. It has created a $1 billion fund to reduce emissions and start clearing carbon. This ambitious commitment is unprecedented and sets Microsoft apart from its entire sector. Microsoft received the highest ESG rating of AAA from MSCI ESG Research in September 2019.\n\n***Prologis (PLD)***\n\nPrologis is a logistics-focused REIT with multiple \u201cfirst company to\u2026\u201d accomplishments in the ESG space. Prologis is the first real estate company to issue green bonds. It is also the first real estate company to be awarded the WELL certification by the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI). Additionally, Prologis is the first logistics company to receive approved SBTs or \u201cScience-Based Targets\u201d necessary to meet the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement of 2015. The company ranks highly on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World list and on the Investor\u2019s Business Daily (IBD) 50 Best ESG Companies list."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 1}]}

Im about to present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to 75x your  money\\*\\*.\\*\\* Too much, or too good to be true? Im being conservative. Hear  me out.\n\n**First, I shall Flex:**\n\n1. I  am an MD and a Professor. To spell out the obvious, I have insight into  what matters in the medical world. Many pure researchers lack this  (cough cough Elisabeth Bik). In addition, As medical school faculty, If I  can't figure it out, I know who to ask.\n2. I started investing (profitably) before most of you were born.\n\nWhy  flex? To make it abundantly clear, my opinion on biotech investing  matters just a little. With that said, once more, listen up!\n\n**The Pickle:**\n\nYou  youngins haven't noticed, but Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of  death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. The kicker is,  there is NO effective treatment.\n\nThe  FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm. This drug has  significant adverse events. The risk of brain swelling requires serial  Brain MRIs. It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV  infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k. Most incredible is  that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate  trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make  later).\n\nAgain, for emphasis, the  FDA still approved it because the need is that severe. President Biden  recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation  over a trillion dollars.\n\n**The Fix: $SAVA**\n\nCassava  Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive  function in its CMS trial. The degree and duration of improvement have  NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic.  It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that  behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it  doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the  discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.\n\nYes,  we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc. A genuine  criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased  critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the  usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives  conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the  ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.\n\nWithout  getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere  criticisms is Phase 3 trials. There is no valid argument against this  statement. This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use  absolute phrases. If you take away only one point from this article,  then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start  early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more  about him later). Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after  the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also  threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy. Be angry,  fellow apes, be angry. Im just getting started, BTW.\n\nDo  market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal?  They do. That is why the stock price went from &lt; $1 to an ATH of  $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my  family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the  first place.\n\n**The Villan and His Massacre:**\n\nJordan  Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a \"Citizens Petition.\"  A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit)  out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical  to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed  another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.\n\nEssentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second,  sold their shares. SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the  making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog ([https://ad-science.org/](https://ad-science.org/)),  Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it  biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.\n\n1. Jordan  Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that  patients are literally dying as they wait. WTF!? Why, why why?? If you  aren't angry, somethings wrong with you. JT states he is concerned for  patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there  is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected,  JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly.  In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did  JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that  is the \\*only\\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is  safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall  continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these  petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is  horrendous (3% success rate)? Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who  uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD  in its purest form.\n2. Then  why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous  document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe  even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my  position by 30%. With that said, Im not surprised the masses started  selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent,  it's an \\*opportunity\\*\u2014a second chance to buy the stock on clearance.\n\n**The Financials:**\n\n$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue.\n\nFifty  million patients are suffering from AD globally. 6 million of those  patients reside in the US. Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American  market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs  $20k annually, just a bit over a third the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's  soon to fail drug):\n\n1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000\n\nThat  calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up  as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment  options). The current stock price is $50. The overly conservative  valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750\n\nThe above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia.\n\n**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**\n\nIf  you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading  causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a  hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of  death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment.  Thats devastating for patients, but families? It's not uncommon for  families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they \"can't  handle it anymore.\" This market is massive and unaddressed! Severely,  painfully, and gravely unaddressed.\n\nI  have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires  (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process. JT is only the  face of this farce. Behind him are many short positions making a 100  million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their  short-term gain. There is something far more concerning.\n\n**The Plot Thickens:**\n\nWhat  I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or  short-term price action. There is something much more sinister. Biogen  has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved. Now it  is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a  problem:\n\nFDA advisory committee  voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then  saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently,  a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and  Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to  support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and  Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the  country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's  AD drug. This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you  to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no  other therapy on the market. Well, what happens if a new, more effective  medication shows up?\n\n**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**\n\nBack  to our Villian JT. JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the  initial \"Citizens Patetion\") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works. Why? I  speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous  whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried  about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in  profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is  more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer. There is  little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less. When that  happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug. Biogen already  has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to  rejuvenate the companies earnings. Then expediently and as expected,  Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.\n\nI  believe that is the root issue. Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become  furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam! A group of us have  gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to  investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).\n\n**Short term price action:**\n\n1. Im  expecting the SP to bounce. After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a  perfect overreaction play. If you dont know what Im talking about, you  can look up \"overreaction with reversion to the mean.\"\n2. Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within \"weeks to months.\"\n3. Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks. (\"Soon\" per Remi)\n4. Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.\n\n\\#SAVA's  float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted  with utilization of &gt;90%. It'll take very little to make SAVA move,  big. Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.\n\nI  have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on  SAVA. My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!). I'll  finish with one last piece of advice. Over 19 years of investing, my  most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading  and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment  by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further  propagated by \"experts\" tweeting and commenting with their hidden  agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual  published results, but apparently, her opinion counts? Comments of her  blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical  vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, \"oh, he sounds  smart, so he must be right.\" or \"That sounds complicated, he must be on  to something.\" In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical  details are fooling many. DFV saw something well before masses, and he  was paid handsomely for it.\n\nIf my  opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen,  then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in  with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs.  a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.\n\nI am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD before making any decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 0}]}

An investment\u2019s ESG score measures the sustainability of an investment in three specific categories: environmental, social and corporate governance.\n\nInvestors interested in environmental, social and governance issues often cite climate concerns as guiding their ESG investments.\n\nThey were rewarded during the market crash as oil prices cratered. In the first quarter, sustainability-focused funds held up better than the broader fund market during the initial bear market sell-off \u2013 driven in part by less exposure to fossil fuel energy.\n\nThat said, ESG goes beyond not buying petroleum companies; there's the \"S\" and the \"G\" parts, too, and those may take greater prominence as people focus on health care amid the pandemic and the social unrest triggered by systemic racism.\n\nThe global sustainable fund universe attracted $45.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020, versus an outflow of $384.7 billion from the overall fund universe. In the U.S. specifically, the research firm found that in the first quarter, flows into open-end and sustainable ETFs reached $10.5 billion, eclipsing the previous record set in 2019's fourth quarter.\n\nA June survey in 2020 from global investment manager Nuveen showed high-net-worth investors are starting to choose ESG for its outperformance, in addition to having a positive social impact, with 53% of respondents citing returns as their top reason to invest in ESG.\n\nAs such, it seems to be a wise choice to get started on an ESG portfolio. Here are some picks to get you started.\n\n***Coca-Cola (KO)***\n\nAs a mega-cap stock with a current market value around $250 billion, Coca-Cola has already partially recovered from the loss in sales due to the pandemic. Analysts suggest that by providing a dividend yield of approximately 3.1%, Coca-Cola makes the list of the top recovery stocks of 2021.\n\nMoreover, if you\u2019re looking for companies that strictly adhere to ESG policies, Coca-Cola has an AA rating from MSCI. The company performs exceptionally well when it comes to waste management, ensuring health and safety standards, and controlling the carbon footprint per product.\n\nThese attributes make it one of the leading ESG dividend stock companies in the beverage industry. Interestingly, only 15% have an AA rating from MSCI, while only 9% have a higher AAA rating.\n\n***Honeywell (HON)***\n\nHoneywell is an ESG-compliant company that shows high growth potential due to its share-price appreciation.\n\nThe Street predicts around 11% annual average growth for the company in the next few years, with a strong \u2018Buy\u2019 rating. Honeywell has consistently raised its dividends since 2014, going up from 45 cents per share to 95 cents last year.\n\nAs far as ESG compliance is concerned, Honeywell holds an AA rating from MSCI. Offering a dividend yield of 1.6%, Honeywell maintains its ESG rating among 14% of its industry peers, having the AA rating.\n\n***NVIDIA (NVDA)***\n\nThis is a well-known company producing graphics and video processing cards, remained unaffected by the pandemic. Analysts suggest that the company is bound to face the most prominent growth rate in the tech sector, surpassing artificial intelligence and auto technology. On the ESG end, NVIDIA is highly rated because of its mineral policy and effective corporate governance. The company uses rare minerals to build its chips and cards; therefore, it has a stringent policy against unethical procurement and mining of these minerals.\n\n***Chr. Hansen (CHYHY)***\n\nThe Danish human nutrition giant Chr. Hansen ranks high in ESG compliance due to its sustainable practices regarding food security and waste management. The company mainly produces bacteria that help curb the extended use of harmful pesticides while increasing crop yield at the same time.\n\nMoreover, Chr. Hansen has successfully developed an accounting system according to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. This helps the company assess the impact of each product and display the metrics to investors.\n\nThese extra measures place Chr. Hansen in the first place on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations List.\n\n***MBH Corporation (MBHCF)***\n\nMBH is a holding company actively building a portfolio of profitable, earnings accretive, debt-free small to medium enterprises (SME) that are expected to have a higher-than-normal growth profile as part of a larger organization. The company's operating model leaves management of the acquired companies to operate autonomously and fully accountable to develop and grow their businesses. As part of a larger organization, the acquired companies and in turn, MBH get the benefits of both worlds. This small holding company may have just started out, but it is pumping out revenue steadily and healthily and pays a 2% dividend. MBH Corporation has won five stars for their ESG credentials, getting into the top 1% of the nearly 2,000 businesses in the Support the Goals database. They have achieved this level of commitment through their work with inequality and climate goals. Support the Goals encourages businesses to take responsibility and the organisation expects companies 'to demonstrate how you support the world\u2019s most important action plan'.\n\n***NextEra Energy (NEE)***\n\nNextEra is the largest electric utility by market cap. Over the last few decades, the company has been consistently reducing its emissions through increased renewable energy use. Its CO2 emissions are 55% less than those of an average US utility. NextEra has now set an ambitious goal of reducing CO2 emissions, by 2025, by 67% from its 2005 base levels. This goal effectively means that absolute CO2 emissions would go down by 40% even while NextEra\u2019s energy production would double during that time. To its credit, the company last year received a best-in-class preparedness assessment by S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 ESG Evaluation. NextEra has, essentially, received the highest ranking given by S&amp;P to a company within the utility sector.\n\n***Microsoft (MSFT)***\n\nMicrosoft has taken the lead in its commitment towards carbon mitigation by becoming the first company among its peers to target \u201ccarbon negative\u201d status by 2030. It has created a $1 billion fund to reduce emissions and start clearing carbon. This ambitious commitment is unprecedented and sets Microsoft apart from its entire sector. Microsoft received the highest ESG rating of AAA from MSCI ESG Research in September 2019.\n\n***Prologis (PLD)***\n\nPrologis is a logistics-focused REIT with multiple \u201cfirst company to\u2026\u201d accomplishments in the ESG space. Prologis is the first real estate company to issue green bonds. It is also the first real estate company to be awarded the WELL certification by the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI). Additionally, Prologis is the first logistics company to receive approved SBTs or \u201cScience-Based Targets\u201d necessary to meet the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement of 2015. The company ranks highly on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World list and on the Investor\u2019s Business Daily (IBD) 50 Best ESG Companies list."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 1}]}

Im about to present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to 75x your  money\\*\\*.\\*\\* Too much, or too good to be true? Im being conservative. Hear  me out.\n\n**First, I shall Flex:**\n\n1. I  am an MD and a Professor. To spell out the obvious, I have insight into  what matters in the medical world. Many pure researchers lack this  (cough cough Elisabeth Bik). In addition, As medical school faculty, If I  can't figure it out, I know who to ask.\n2. I started investing (profitably) before most of you were born.\n\nWhy  flex? To make it abundantly clear, my opinion on biotech investing  matters just a little. With that said, once more, listen up!\n\n**The Pickle:**\n\nYou  youngins haven't noticed, but Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of  death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. The kicker is,  there is NO effective treatment.\n\nThe  FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm. This drug has  significant adverse events. The risk of brain swelling requires serial  Brain MRIs. It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV  infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k. Most incredible is  that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate  trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make  later).\n\nAgain, for emphasis, the  FDA still approved it because the need is that severe. President Biden  recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation  over a trillion dollars.\n\n**The Fix: $SAVA**\n\nCassava  Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive  function in its CMS trial. The degree and duration of improvement have  NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic.  It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that  behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it  doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the  discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.\n\nYes,  we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc. A genuine  criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased  critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the  usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives  conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the  ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.\n\nWithout  getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere  criticisms is Phase 3 trials. There is no valid argument against this  statement. This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use  absolute phrases. If you take away only one point from this article,  then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start  early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more  about him later). Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after  the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also  threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy. Be angry,  fellow apes, be angry. Im just getting started, BTW.\n\nDo  market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal?  They do. That is why the stock price went from &lt; $1 to an ATH of  $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my  family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the  first place.\n\n**The Villan and His Massacre:**\n\nJordan  Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a \"Citizens Petition.\"  A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit)  out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical  to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed  another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.\n\nEssentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second,  sold their shares. SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the  making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog ([https://ad-science.org/](https://ad-science.org/)),  Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it  biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.\n\n1. Jordan  Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that  patients are literally dying as they wait. WTF!? Why, why why?? If you  aren't angry, somethings wrong with you. JT states he is concerned for  patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there  is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected,  JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly.  In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did  JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that  is the \\*only\\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is  safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall  continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these  petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is  horrendous (3% success rate)? Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who  uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD  in its purest form.\n2. Then  why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous  document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe  even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my  position by 30%. With that said, Im not surprised the masses started  selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent,  it's an \\*opportunity\\*\u2014a second chance to buy the stock on clearance.\n\n**The Financials:**\n\n$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue.\n\nFifty  million patients are suffering from AD globally. 6 million of those  patients reside in the US. Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American  market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs  $20k annually, just a bit over a third the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's  soon to fail drug):\n\n1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000\n\nThat  calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up  as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment  options). The current stock price is $50. The overly conservative  valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750\n\nThe above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia.\n\n**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**\n\nIf  you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading  causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a  hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of  death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment.  Thats devastating for patients, but families? It's not uncommon for  families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they \"can't  handle it anymore.\" This market is massive and unaddressed! Severely,  painfully, and gravely unaddressed.\n\nI  have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires  (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process. JT is only the  face of this farce. Behind him are many short positions making a 100  million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their  short-term gain. There is something far more concerning.\n\n**The Plot Thickens:**\n\nWhat  I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or  short-term price action. There is something much more sinister. Biogen  has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved. Now it  is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a  problem:\n\nFDA advisory committee  voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then  saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently,  a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and  Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to  support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and  Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the  country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's  AD drug. This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you  to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no  other therapy on the market. Well, what happens if a new, more effective  medication shows up?\n\n**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**\n\nBack  to our Villian JT. JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the  initial \"Citizens Patetion\") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works. Why? I  speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous  whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried  about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in  profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is  more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer. There is  little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less. When that  happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug. Biogen already  has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to  rejuvenate the companies earnings. Then expediently and as expected,  Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.\n\nI  believe that is the root issue. Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become  furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam! A group of us have  gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to  investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).\n\n**Short term price action:**\n\n1. Im  expecting the SP to bounce. After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a  perfect overreaction play. If you dont know what Im talking about, you  can look up \"overreaction with reversion to the mean.\"\n2. Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within \"weeks to months.\"\n3. Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks. (\"Soon\" per Remi)\n4. Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.\n\n\\#SAVA's  float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted  with utilization of &gt;90%. It'll take very little to make SAVA move,  big. Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.\n\nI  have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on  SAVA. My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!). I'll  finish with one last piece of advice. Over 19 years of investing, my  most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading  and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment  by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further  propagated by \"experts\" tweeting and commenting with their hidden  agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual  published results, but apparently, her opinion counts? Comments of her  blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical  vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, \"oh, he sounds  smart, so he must be right.\" or \"That sounds complicated, he must be on  to something.\" In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical  details are fooling many. DFV saw something well before masses, and he  was paid handsomely for it.\n\nIf my  opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen,  then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in  with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs.  a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.\n\nI am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD before making any decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 1}]}

A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, as the name implies, is a denial of service (DoS) attack that originates from multiple sources simultaneously. A DoS attack is an attack meant to shut down a machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended users. This is accomplished by flooding the target with traffic, or sending it information that triggers a crash making the targeted system unresponsive.\n\nThe most common DoS attacks are Buffer Overflow attacks - sending more traffic to a network address than the programmers have bult the system to handle. It includes most attack types, in addition to others that are designed to exploit bugs specific to certain applications or networks. By saturating a targeted server with an overwhelming amount of packets, a malicious actor is able to oversaturate server capacity, resulting in denial-of-service. In order for most DoS flood attacks to be successful, the malicious actor must have more available bandwidth than the target. An attack type in which a memory buffer overflow can cause a machine to consume all available hard disk space, memory, or CPU time. This form of exploit often results in sluggish behavior, system crashes, or other deleterious server behaviors, resulting in denial-of-service.\n\nIn the early days of the Internet, websites would exist on individual hosts, and single-source DoS attacks could be effective. Today, this is much less likely; sites are hosted on the cloud and/or across multiple data centers, integrated with CDNs, and so on. Even using techniques such as amplification and reflection, it is very difficult for a single-source attack to have enough bandwidth to overwhelm a modern site\u2019s resources.\n\n**Why it\u2019s hard to defend against DDoS attacks**\n\nModern security technologies have developed mechanisms to defend against most forms of DoS attacks, but due to the unique characteristics of DDoS, it is still regarded as an elevated threat and is of higher concern to organizations that fear being targeted by such an attack. DDoS attack occurs when multiple systems orchestrate a synchronized DoS attack to a single target. The essential difference is that instead of being attacked from one location, the target is attacked from many locations at once.\n\n**Companies Developing DDoS Solutions for the Financial Sector**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve unpacked what a DDoS attack is and why banks/fintech companies are such a prime target, lets take a look at some of the players developing cutting-edge solutions for future protection:\n\n**CloudFlare (NYSE: NET)** is a leader in the field of web architecture/security with a specialty on DDoS mitigation. The firm went public in September 2019 at a share price of $18. Its stock price has steadily climbed since the IPO, continuing its uptick at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as consumers and companies increasingly turned online. According to recent reviews by both IDC MarketSpace and Forrester, CloudFare has been recognized as an innovator in the field of DDoS prevention and mitigation. CloudFare offers one of the most comprehensive DDoS prevention toolkits on the market, and it is compatible with web applications, network infrastructure, and the IoT. NET is a pretty solid tech investment pick, with a consensus rating of BUY and an average target price of $205 (up from $137). In other words, this is an established player in the cyber solutions market with a reputation that precedes itself and forecasts for strong upside moving into 2022.\n\n**RadWare (NASDAQ: RDWR)** is another household name in the world of net/data security. This Israeli-American company has created a niche for itself in the space of cyber security and application delivery solutions for applications in physical, virtual, cloud, and software defined data centers worldwide. One of their flagship products is DefensePro, which provides automated DDoS protection from fast-moving, high-volume, encrypted or very-short-duration threats. RadWare has been workin with leading players in the financial services and banking industries for nearly a decade, and its DefensePro is considered a \u201cgold standard\u201d for anti-DDoS solutions. Notwithstanding a recent downgrade from overperforming to performing by Oppenheimer, RDWR holds a BUY consensus after gaining nearly 30% in share value over the past month alone. Definitely another DDoS prevention provider to keep tabs on.\n\n**HUB Security (TASE: HUB)** is an Israeli player that has surged in 2021. From their merger with ALD in February to their $22M acquisition of ComSec global in September to their recent declaration of intent for a NASDAQ listing, HUB is fast becoming a disruptor in the confidential computing field. They recently clinched deals with three European national banks for a DDoS simulation platform designed to up readiness and defensive protocol. More specifically, their D.Storm product is a system that collects data from the bot attacks in real-time and presents it to the user for in-depth analysis. In essence, D.Storm provides actionable intelligence to banks and fintech actors that they need to manage the risks in the face of an increasingly sophisticated threat landscape. Though listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, HUB is on my watchlist for the anticipated NASDAQ listing and the significant value-multiplier it will entail for HUB\u2019s enterprise value.\n\nThis went on a bit longer than expected, but I hope readers who made it to the bottom have a better idea of what a DDoS attack is, why they are particularly worrisome for the financial services sector, and who some of the big names working on mitigation solutions are. I\u2019m a tech investor and not a financial advisor, so DYOR. And Happy New Years kiddos, stay warm and wear a mask."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 0}]}

Most U.S. jurisdictions had forced restaurants to close their dining rooms to limit the spread of the coronavirus by March 2020. While some restaurants unfortunately closed never to reopen, others found an alternate solution through delivery or carry-out model with varying levels of success. With such successful results, many food companies and restaurants have adopted this new concept to their benefit after seeing that this trend has really taken the limelight. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about a success story in the process, a ghost kitchen innovator that has aggressively strategized it\u2019s expansion into various parts of the world, and soon to take over the United States. With much optimism, I can say that JustKitchen is onto big things. \n\nJustKitchen is primarily an operator of ghost kitchens specializing in the development and marketing of proprietary and delivery-only food brands for consumers.  Originally hailing from Taiwan, JustKitchen (JK.V) is currently listed on the Toronto Venture Exchange (TSXV) and Frankfurt\u2019s DAX.  Their recent slew of deals with American supermarket/food store chains illustrates JK\u2019s global ambitions and steadily unfolding expansion plan.\n\nOne factor that I feel really distinguishes this company from competitors is its unique hub-and-spoke operating model.  In a nutshell, this paradigm arrays spokes, or smaller nodes often located in dense urban settings, around a centralized hub.  Just Kitchen recently announced the opening of a new spoke in Taiwan, thereby bringing the company to a grand total of 20 active kitchens. JustKitchen has seen orders for delivery services increase to 90,000 in monthly numbers since March 2020. Expected profits from each hub are estimated around $5 million. In addition to in-house brands and partner restaurants, JustMarket is an e-commerce grocery delivery platform allowing customers to add grocery items.  In short, we can anticipate a cascade of profit in the coming quarters based on these robust metrics.\n\nThe company has recently collaborated with TGI Fridays to offer a new delivery-only TGIF Go Burgers Collection, along with its new in-house brand The Cali Vibe Bento. Aside from introducing new menus, the company has innovatively introduced it\u2019s Wow Chow brand, which provides freshly delivered food to pets. All of this is made possible with online and mobile application based food ordering, carried out by third-party delivery companies like GrubHub ($GRUB) and UberEats ($UBER).\n\nJustKitchen is excelling in Asian markets and working to establish itself in the North American/US ghost kitchen market.To date, they have:\n\n* Taiwanese food/restaurant brands in Hong Kong, and plan to tap markets in Singapore, the Philippines and US for the remainder of 2021.\n* Opened a ghost kitchen in the world-renowned Taipei 101 skyscraper.\n* Went public in April of 2020 and showed that each of its locations make about $1.3 million annually with a 15 to 20% margin.\n* Expected profits from each hub are estimated around $5 million. \n* Justkitchen will enter the United States, focusing on the West Coast.\n* As part of their \u201cexpansion-plan\u201d for 2022, Justktichen is planning on establishing operations in Canada and Asian-Pacific region countries.\n* Newly developed partnership with TGI Fridays and offering of Cali Vibe Bento brand, both of which are huge for increased name recognition.\n* JustKitchen signed collaborative agreements with Foodpanda and Zeek to reach more on-demand customers in Hong Kong.\n\nThis is an exciting growth industry to keep an eye on in years to come, JustKitchen has achieved its targets gradually while generating significant upside value to its shareholders. This past week the stock has shown some nice growth with an increase of 11.86 percent, JK\u2019s target value is considerably above its current value of $1.32. Do your own DD and see why I\u2019m so interested in this company, and of course, this is not financial advice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/upg0a5vcsdd71.png?width=1344&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d5c9d2c6d22af69e6c3a4903fcd410ec6c2dce9c"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 0}]}

However, even seasoned investors can find some use out of this by getting back to the basics. This quick guide isn't meant to focus on financial metrics, but in an effort to explore companies based on the world around us.\n\nPreface: This is directed for individuals that are just starting to invest, in hopes of empowering them to continue to grow upon the knowledge they learn on in this post! This is also a post to help highlight a new social investing platform I've been building called [Mainstreet](https://mainstreetportfolio.com/) (currently in beta) that helps you invest with your friends, track your portfolios, and build communities with one another. Happy investing!\n\n**How To Find Stocks (for the Normal Investor)**\n\nOne of the most common questions I get when talking to someone just getting into investing, is something along the lines of \u201cWhich stocks are good?\u201d or \u201cHow do I find stocks to invest in?\u201d. Some of the reasons individuals choose not to invest is due to the \u201clack of knowledge\u201d or perhaps they are \u201cintimidated by the market\u201d. These are all valid reasons to not invest, but I feel like by providing the education and resources to learn about these topics in an easy and digestible manner will help people overcome these barriers and feel empowered to take control of their wealth, whether it\u2019s through real estate, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll dive into some of the strategies and methods I used to help gain knowledge and insight when investing in the stock market. Keep in mind this is not the definitive guide, but it\u2019s steps that I took to help me become more financially literate about the stock market. Everyone\u2019s path to financial education is different and unique and this is only meant to provide a different perspective for someone just starting out.\n\n**Pay Attention to the World Around You**\n\nThe first thing I usually tell people is, start to observe the world around you and the businesses that are close to your network. You\u2019ll easily be able to find many companies if you start to shift your mindset and look at how the world functions.\n\nFirst, look at what kind of products or services you consume. Do you need to get your fix of vanilla latte at Starbucks ($SBUX) in the morning? More of a fast food person? Let\u2019s look at McDonalds ($MCD), Chipotle ($CMG), Shake Shack ($SHAK), or Restaurant Brands International ($QSR). Are you a hardcore gamer? Well, I\u2019m sure one of your games or consoles comes from Sony ($SNE), Nintendo ($NTDOY), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), or Microsoft ($MSFT). Or maybe you\u2019ve been working from home? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had to buy some products from Amazon ($AMZN) or Wayfair ($W) to spruce up your office space. You\u2019re probably also using things like Zoom ($ZM), Google Drive ($GOOG or $GOOGL), or Slack to keep yourself productive during the day.\n\n**Build a Watchlist**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got the brain working a little, it\u2019s important to start building a watchlist of all the stocks you\u2019ve thought of. You can use your broker watchlist tool, or even an app like Yahoo Finance, WeBull, etc. Sort them in a way that works for you, whether it\u2019s by sector (financial, tech, industrials), subsector (gaming, oil, e-commerce), or even by priority (Watchlist Tier 1, Watchlist Tier 2, etc.)\n\nOrganization is key when building your watchlist. You\u2019ll want to have them organized because it\u2019ll help you get a quick glance of what\u2019s happening in the market at any given time. By checking on the stocks you\u2019ve added to your watchlist periodically, you\u2019ll learn how they move according to catalysts (market news, earnings, etc) and be able to plan how and when you\u2019d like to invest in them.\n\n**Search within an Index Fund or ETF**\n\nA great way to search up companies is by looking at current index fund or ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) allocations. With index funds, you can look at the holdings of the S&amp;P500 (Top 500 American companies) or the Nasdaq 100 (Most active, largest 100 Nasdaq companies). At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of the S&amp;P500 are:\n\n1. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)\n2. Microsoft Corp ($MSFT)\n3. Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN)\n4. Facebook, Inc. ($FB)\n5. Alphabet Inc. Class A ($GOOGL)\n6. Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG)\n7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc ($BRK.B)\n8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ($JPM)\n9. Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA)\n10. Johnson &amp; Johnson ($JNJ)\n\nAnother way is to look into the holdings of an ETF. There are tons of ETFs out there that track indices like $SPY and $QQQ, which track the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, as well as more focused sector ETFs, like the ARK Innovation Fund ($ARKK) or the O\u2019Shares Global Internet Giants Fund ($OGIG).\n\nOne of my favorites is ARKK, as they focus on disruptive innovation and change. So, for example, if something like this was to resonate with you, looking into their top holdings will give you some insight on what kinds of companies you\u2019d need to do research on to gain exposure to this particular strategy. At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of ARKK are:\n\n1. Tesla, Inc ($TSLA)\n2. Teladoc Health, Inc. ($TDOC)\n3. Roku, Inc. ($ROKU)\n4. Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)\n5. Square, Inc. ($SQ)\n6. Shopify, Inc ($SHOP)\n7. Spotify Technology SA ($SPOT)\n8. Twilio, Inc (TWLO)\n9. Coinbase Global, Inc ($COIN)\n10. Unity Software, Inc ($U)\n\nHopefully looking into index funds or ETFs like the ones listed above help spark curiosity and the urge to build on your own knowledge!\n\n**Invest in Things You Understand (Personal, Business)**\n\nAnother piece of advice I like to give people is to only invest in areas of the market you understand. For example, if I see a sector like biotech or cybersecurity shoot up 50% in the last three months, but I don\u2019t really understand how this industry works, don\u2019t put your money in it. Simple as that. If the whole stock market started to fall, these will be the easiest to target as a potential sell because you don\u2019t understand the industry or the company at all. Your conviction on the stock is low so incentive to hold onto it for the long term is also low.\n\nFor me, I\u2019m a big gamer and I understand the industry well. To compare it to the previous example above, I can take those companies and further extrapolate to build upon my research using my existing knowledge. As a result, I\u2019m aware that gaming consoles use chips from Intel ($INTC), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), as well as GPU processors from Nvidia ($NVDA). Many video games are developed on software applications like Unity ($U). I\u2019m also aware that a large population of gamers and gaming companies come from Asia and Europe, therefore I can look into stocks like Ubisoft ($UBI), Capcom ($CCOEF), or even Tencent Holdings ($TCEHY). What about gaming accessories from Corsair ($CRSR) or Logitech ($LOGI)? And let\u2019s not forget about Gamestop ($GME)!\n\nAnother great way to leverage your knowledge is to look at your workplace and how the business is structured from within. Does your company utilize products or services from other companies? If you work at a software company, perhaps you use Cisco ($CSCO) or Ciena ($CIEN) for your networking. If your company uses customer or sales support, you may be using something like Salesforce ($CRM), Twilio ($TWLO), or Zendesk ($ZEN). To optimize your business, your company may also be leveraging cybersecurity services like Palo Alto ($PALO), Okta ($OKTA), or Crowdstrike ($CRWD). By looking within your own workplace, you\u2019ll be able to do a bit of deeper digging to find stocks that services businesses and aren\u2019t as customer facing.\n\nUnderstanding an industry well allows you to build your conviction in that industry. By fully grasping the ins and outs, you\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re invested in. This prevents panicking or selling if you suddenly see a red day, because you know what the company is fundamentally and potentially capable of. It also allows you to get invested in the companies you\u2019re buying, ultimately feeling like a small owner of the company, which is exactly what the function of stocks are.\n\n**Diversify your Portfolio**\n\nSo now, you\u2019ve done a bit of research and found a ton of stocks you might potentially invest in. Now what? Well, now is where you want to think about risk management and portfolio diversity.\n\nFrom Investopedia, diversification is a \u201crisk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\u201d\n\nHow do I know what\u2019s diversified enough? Great question, but that\u2019s up to your personal risk tolerance. Try not to allocate all your stocks into one single sector or area of the market. By broadening out in sector (tech, industrial), subsector (5G, banks), geography (US, Asia, Europe), market cap (large, medium, small), and more, you can feel comfortable and confident with your investments. The last thing you want to be doing is checking your stocks every minute and wondering if you should buy more or sell it off. Also consider the timeline of your allocations. The majority of my portfolio is in long-term investments (3+ years), but I do have a small portion of my portfolio allocated to mid-term and momentum investments (less than two years), such as options and swing trading. It\u2019s up to each individual investor to determine these allocations and stay committed to knowing when to change your allocation based on your time horizon.\n\nConsider this portfolio of $10000 dollars: (Stock, dollar amount\\[%\\], sector/subsector/geography/market cap)\n\n* Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA - $1000 (10%) - Tech / EV / USA / Large\n* Alibaba Group ($BABA) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / E-Commerce / ASIA / Large\n* Bank of America ($BAC) - $1000 (10%) - Financials / Banking / USA / Large\n* GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Pharma / EU / Large\n* Brookfield Renewable ($BEP)- $1000 (10%) - Energy / Renewable / CAN / Large\n* Papa John\u2019s Int. ($PZZA)- $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Consumer/ USA / Mid\n* Ubisoft Entertainment ($UBI) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / Gaming / EU / Mid\n* Barrick Gold ($GOLD) - $1000 (10%) - Industrials / Mining / CAN / Mid\n* Aurora Cannabis ($ACB) - $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Cannabis / CAN / Small\n* Nano-X Imaging ($NNOX) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Telehealth / Israel / Small\n\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve been able to allocate into many different sectors, subsectors, geographies, and market caps. If one of these companies were to disappear tomorrow, we\u2019d still have 90% of our portfolio remaining.\n\nOf our mock portfolio, our sector allocation is the following: 30% Technology, 20% Consumer, 20% Health, and 10% each in Financials, Energy, and Industrials. Our subsector allocation is fully diversified in 10 subsectors of the market: Electric Vehicles, E-Commerce, Banking, Pharma, Renewable Energy, Consumer, Gaming, Mining, Cannabis, and Telehealth. In terms of geography, our allocation is the following: 30% USA, 30% Canada, 20% Europe, 10% Asia, and 10% Israel. With our market cap, our allocation is the following: 50% large, 30% mid, and 20% small. As you can see, this portfolio is well diversified in terms of sector, subsector, region, and market cap. These allocations will ultimately be up to you, as you will be in control of your portfolio.\n\n**Now You\u2019re Ready!**\n\nAnd that\u2019s it, we\u2019ve learned how to find stocks by looking at your surroundings using your own knowledge from your personal and work life and now you understand how to properly diversify a portfolio based on your own risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\n**Mainstreet**\n\nThis article is part of a series of articles aimed at assisting investors to take control of their wealth on Mainstreet.

Well, now is where you want to think about risk management and portfolio diversity.\n\nFrom Investopedia, diversification is a \u201crisk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\u201d\n\nHow do I know what\u2019s diversified enough? Great question, but that\u2019s up to your personal risk tolerance. Try not to allocate all your stocks into one single sector or area of the market. By broadening out in sector (tech, industrial), subsector (5G, banks), geography (US, Asia, Europe), market cap (large, medium, small), and more, you can feel comfortable and confident with your investments. The last thing you want to be doing is checking your stocks every minute and wondering if you should buy more or sell it off. Also consider the timeline of your allocations. The majority of my portfolio is in long-term investments (3+ years), but I do have a small portion of my portfolio allocated to mid-term and momentum investments (less than two years), such as options and swing trading. It\u2019s up to each individual investor to determine these allocations and stay committed to knowing when to change your allocation based on your time horizon.\n\nConsider this portfolio of $10000 dollars: (Stock, dollar amount\\[%\\], sector/subsector/geography/market cap)\n\n* Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA - $1000 (10%) - Tech / EV / USA / Large\n* Alibaba Group ($BABA) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / E-Commerce / ASIA / Large\n* Bank of America ($BAC) - $1000 (10%) - Financials / Banking / USA / Large\n* GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Pharma / EU / Large\n* Brookfield Renewable ($BEP)- $1000 (10%) - Energy / Renewable / CAN / Large\n* Papa John\u2019s Int. ($PZZA)- $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Consumer/ USA / Mid\n* Ubisoft Entertainment ($UBI) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / Gaming / EU / Mid\n* Barrick Gold ($GOLD) - $1000 (10%) - Industrials / Mining / CAN / Mid\n* Aurora Cannabis ($ACB) - $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Cannabis / CAN / Small\n* Nano-X Imaging ($NNOX) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Telehealth / Israel / Small\n\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve been able to allocate into many different sectors, subsectors, geographies, and market caps. If one of these companies were to disappear tomorrow, we\u2019d still have 90% of our portfolio remaining.\n\nOf our mock portfolio, our sector allocation is the following: 30% Technology, 20% Consumer, 20% Health, and 10% each in Financials, Energy, and Industrials. Our subsector allocation is fully diversified in 10 subsectors of the market: Electric Vehicles, E-Commerce, Banking, Pharma, Renewable Energy, Consumer, Gaming, Mining, Cannabis, and Telehealth. In terms of geography, our allocation is the following: 30% USA, 30% Canada, 20% Europe, 10% Asia, and 10% Israel. With our market cap, our allocation is the following: 50% large, 30% mid, and 20% small. As you can see, this portfolio is well diversified in terms of sector, subsector, region, and market cap. These allocations will ultimately be up to you, as you will be in control of your portfolio.\n\n**Now You\u2019re Ready!**\n\nAnd that\u2019s it, we\u2019ve learned how to find stocks by looking at your surroundings using your own knowledge from your personal and work life and now you understand how to properly diversify a portfolio based on your own risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\n**Mainstreet**\n\nThis article is part of a series of articles aimed at assisting investors to take control of their wealth on Mainstreet.

An investment\u2019s ESG score measures the sustainability of an investment in three specific categories: environmental, social and corporate governance.\n\nInvestors interested in environmental, social and governance issues often cite climate concerns as guiding their ESG investments.\n\nThey were rewarded during the market crash as oil prices cratered. In the first quarter, sustainability-focused funds held up better than the broader fund market during the initial bear market sell-off \u2013 driven in part by less exposure to fossil fuel energy.\n\nThat said, ESG goes beyond not buying petroleum companies; there's the \"S\" and the \"G\" parts, too, and those may take greater prominence as people focus on health care amid the pandemic and the social unrest triggered by systemic racism.\n\nThe global sustainable fund universe attracted $45.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020, versus an outflow of $384.7 billion from the overall fund universe. In the U.S. specifically, the research firm found that in the first quarter, flows into open-end and sustainable ETFs reached $10.5 billion, eclipsing the previous record set in 2019's fourth quarter.\n\nA June survey in 2020 from global investment manager Nuveen showed high-net-worth investors are starting to choose ESG for its outperformance, in addition to having a positive social impact, with 53% of respondents citing returns as their top reason to invest in ESG.\n\nAs such, it seems to be a wise choice to get started on an ESG portfolio. Here are some picks to get you started.\n\n***Coca-Cola (KO)***\n\nAs a mega-cap stock with a current market value around $250 billion, Coca-Cola has already partially recovered from the loss in sales due to the pandemic. Analysts suggest that by providing a dividend yield of approximately 3.1%, Coca-Cola makes the list of the top recovery stocks of 2021.\n\nMoreover, if you\u2019re looking for companies that strictly adhere to ESG policies, Coca-Cola has an AA rating from MSCI. The company performs exceptionally well when it comes to waste management, ensuring health and safety standards, and controlling the carbon footprint per product.\n\nThese attributes make it one of the leading ESG dividend stock companies in the beverage industry. Interestingly, only 15% have an AA rating from MSCI, while only 9% have a higher AAA rating.\n\n***Honeywell (HON)***\n\nHoneywell is an ESG-compliant company that shows high growth potential due to its share-price appreciation.\n\nThe Street predicts around 11% annual average growth for the company in the next few years, with a strong \u2018Buy\u2019 rating. Honeywell has consistently raised its dividends since 2014, going up from 45 cents per share to 95 cents last year.\n\nAs far as ESG compliance is concerned, Honeywell holds an AA rating from MSCI. Offering a dividend yield of 1.6%, Honeywell maintains its ESG rating among 14% of its industry peers, having the AA rating.\n\n***NVIDIA (NVDA)***\n\nThis is a well-known company producing graphics and video processing cards, remained unaffected by the pandemic. Analysts suggest that the company is bound to face the most prominent growth rate in the tech sector, surpassing artificial intelligence and auto technology. On the ESG end, NVIDIA is highly rated because of its mineral policy and effective corporate governance. The company uses rare minerals to build its chips and cards; therefore, it has a stringent policy against unethical procurement and mining of these minerals.\n\n***Chr. Hansen (CHYHY)***\n\nThe Danish human nutrition giant Chr. Hansen ranks high in ESG compliance due to its sustainable practices regarding food security and waste management. The company mainly produces bacteria that help curb the extended use of harmful pesticides while increasing crop yield at the same time.\n\nMoreover, Chr. Hansen has successfully developed an accounting system according to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. This helps the company assess the impact of each product and display the metrics to investors.\n\nThese extra measures place Chr. Hansen in the first place on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations List.\n\n***MBH Corporation (MBHCF)***\n\nMBH is a holding company actively building a portfolio of profitable, earnings accretive, debt-free small to medium enterprises (SME) that are expected to have a higher-than-normal growth profile as part of a larger organization. The company's operating model leaves management of the acquired companies to operate autonomously and fully accountable to develop and grow their businesses. As part of a larger organization, the acquired companies and in turn, MBH get the benefits of both worlds. This small holding company may have just started out, but it is pumping out revenue steadily and healthily and pays a 2% dividend. MBH Corporation has won five stars for their ESG credentials, getting into the top 1% of the nearly 2,000 businesses in the Support the Goals database. They have achieved this level of commitment through their work with inequality and climate goals. Support the Goals encourages businesses to take responsibility and the organisation expects companies 'to demonstrate how you support the world\u2019s most important action plan'.\n\n***NextEra Energy (NEE)***\n\nNextEra is the largest electric utility by market cap. Over the last few decades, the company has been consistently reducing its emissions through increased renewable energy use. Its CO2 emissions are 55% less than those of an average US utility. NextEra has now set an ambitious goal of reducing CO2 emissions, by 2025, by 67% from its 2005 base levels. This goal effectively means that absolute CO2 emissions would go down by 40% even while NextEra\u2019s energy production would double during that time. To its credit, the company last year received a best-in-class preparedness assessment by S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 ESG Evaluation. NextEra has, essentially, received the highest ranking given by S&amp;P to a company within the utility sector.\n\n***Microsoft (MSFT)***\n\nMicrosoft has taken the lead in its commitment towards carbon mitigation by becoming the first company among its peers to target \u201ccarbon negative\u201d status by 2030. It has created a $1 billion fund to reduce emissions and start clearing carbon. This ambitious commitment is unprecedented and sets Microsoft apart from its entire sector. Microsoft received the highest ESG rating of AAA from MSCI ESG Research in September 2019.\n\n***Prologis (PLD)***\n\nPrologis is a logistics-focused REIT with multiple \u201cfirst company to\u2026\u201d accomplishments in the ESG space. Prologis is the first real estate company to issue green bonds. It is also the first real estate company to be awarded the WELL certification by the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI). Additionally, Prologis is the first logistics company to receive approved SBTs or \u201cScience-Based Targets\u201d necessary to meet the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement of 2015. The company ranks highly on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World list and on the Investor\u2019s Business Daily (IBD) 50 Best ESG Companies list."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 1}]}

As the leader in Canada with 100+ dispensaries now running with the Costco discount model, I have high confidence that this model will be what turns the company profitable in the near future, alongside their accretive e-commerce acquisitions. I say this because of their vertical integrated accessories business. This is something that does not get talked about enough for $HITI. Manufacturing the bulk of the accessories they sale in-house, it enables them to make up margins when discounting flower to undercut the legal market and take market share from the illicit market. The #1 thing I will be looking for here is how $HITI manages their operational expenses as they continue to open up more stores - WILL BE CRUCIAL!!\n\nAs noted previously, $HITI continues to purchase accretive e-commerce assets. Not only do they own the top 3 e-commerce websites for cannabis accessories, but also own subscription company Daily High Club and numerous juggernaut CBD e-commerce companies (FabCBD and NuLeaf in US and Blessed CBD in UK). I am sure they have something in Germany in the works knowing Raj or they will go in there with Blessed CBD. All these companies will add more revenue to $HITI and will easily integrate into their current ecosystem - not adding too many expenses. As management continues to buy up profitable assets that easily integrate into $HITI current infrastructure, economies of scales will be achieved - this will take time... PAYTIENCE. $HITI is setting up their e-commerce systems and processes within the cannabis accessories market and CBD markets globally, so that once flower is legalized in the US and other countries, the systems and processes are already in place to plug in a new product (flower). I believe we will see some positive earnings reports throughout 2022 especially in the second half - REMEMBER THIS IS A LONG TERM PLAY! 2023 will be an even better year than 2022.\n\nIn addition, all of the proprietary data that $HITI is accumulating with all of these e-commerce assets and the ones they will buy in the future will be something they will leverage as they expand into other geographic areas. They will know what products to start with and what customer profiles to go after to achieve the highest margins. In addition, they already have 250,000+ Canna Cabana members, and this will only continue to grow as consumers in Canada realize how great the deals are compared to competitors - not only on flower but accessories, which we all know are needed to consume cannabis. Another thing I am bullish on with $HITI and all of its online assets is that once online advertising is legalized for cannabis companies (Google ads) it will only help them make more revenue with higher margins as we all know that online marketing - when done right - can help grow companies even more. And don't get me started on how much more revenue $HITI will make once they begin deliveries of cannabis in March!!!\n\nLastly, when you compare $HITI past 1 year return vs all the MSOS and Canadian LPs, not many companies have weathered the 2021 storm as well as $HITI has. Go to Google Finance or wherever and go to the 1 year chart and compare $HITI returns to other cannabis companies. Most are negative where $HITI has seen a 47.44% gain despite the 2021 accumulation phase. We are near the bottom, we may even see $4 before the next run up but I will just continue accumulating.\n\nWe are in a prime time within this accumulation phase. Don't let it go to waste."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 0}]}

However, even seasoned investors can find some use out of this by getting back to the basics. This quick guide isn't meant to focus on financial metrics, but in an effort to explore companies based on the world around us.\n\nPreface: This is directed for individuals that are just starting to invest, in hopes of empowering them to continue to grow upon the knowledge they learn on in this post! This is also a post to help highlight a new social investing platform I've been building called [Mainstreet](https://mainstreetportfolio.com/) (currently in beta) that helps you invest with your friends, track your portfolios, and build communities with one another. Happy investing!\n\n**How To Find Stocks (for the Normal Investor)**\n\nOne of the most common questions I get when talking to someone just getting into investing, is something along the lines of \u201cWhich stocks are good?\u201d or \u201cHow do I find stocks to invest in?\u201d. Some of the reasons individuals choose not to invest is due to the \u201clack of knowledge\u201d or perhaps they are \u201cintimidated by the market\u201d. These are all valid reasons to not invest, but I feel like by providing the education and resources to learn about these topics in an easy and digestible manner will help people overcome these barriers and feel empowered to take control of their wealth, whether it\u2019s through real estate, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll dive into some of the strategies and methods I used to help gain knowledge and insight when investing in the stock market. Keep in mind this is not the definitive guide, but it\u2019s steps that I took to help me become more financially literate about the stock market. Everyone\u2019s path to financial education is different and unique and this is only meant to provide a different perspective for someone just starting out.\n\n**Pay Attention to the World Around You**\n\nThe first thing I usually tell people is, start to observe the world around you and the businesses that are close to your network. You\u2019ll easily be able to find many companies if you start to shift your mindset and look at how the world functions.\n\nFirst, look at what kind of products or services you consume. Do you need to get your fix of vanilla latte at Starbucks ($SBUX) in the morning? More of a fast food person? Let\u2019s look at McDonalds ($MCD), Chipotle ($CMG), Shake Shack ($SHAK), or Restaurant Brands International ($QSR). Are you a hardcore gamer? Well, I\u2019m sure one of your games or consoles comes from Sony ($SNE), Nintendo ($NTDOY), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), or Microsoft ($MSFT). Or maybe you\u2019ve been working from home? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had to buy some products from Amazon ($AMZN) or Wayfair ($W) to spruce up your office space. You\u2019re probably also using things like Zoom ($ZM), Google Drive ($GOOG or $GOOGL), or Slack to keep yourself productive during the day.\n\n**Build a Watchlist**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got the brain working a little, it\u2019s important to start building a watchlist of all the stocks you\u2019ve thought of. You can use your broker watchlist tool, or even an app like Yahoo Finance, WeBull, etc. Sort them in a way that works for you, whether it\u2019s by sector (financial, tech, industrials), subsector (gaming, oil, e-commerce), or even by priority (Watchlist Tier 1, Watchlist Tier 2, etc.)\n\nOrganization is key when building your watchlist. You\u2019ll want to have them organized because it\u2019ll help you get a quick glance of what\u2019s happening in the market at any given time. By checking on the stocks you\u2019ve added to your watchlist periodically, you\u2019ll learn how they move according to catalysts (market news, earnings, etc) and be able to plan how and when you\u2019d like to invest in them.\n\n**Search within an Index Fund or ETF**\n\nA great way to search up companies is by looking at current index fund or ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) allocations. With index funds, you can look at the holdings of the S&amp;P500 (Top 500 American companies) or the Nasdaq 100 (Most active, largest 100 Nasdaq companies). At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of the S&amp;P500 are:\n\n1. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)\n2. Microsoft Corp ($MSFT)\n3. Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN)\n4. Facebook, Inc. ($FB)\n5. Alphabet Inc. Class A ($GOOGL)\n6. Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG)\n7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc ($BRK.B)\n8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ($JPM)\n9. Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA)\n10. Johnson &amp; Johnson ($JNJ)\n\nAnother way is to look into the holdings of an ETF. There are tons of ETFs out there that track indices like $SPY and $QQQ, which track the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, as well as more focused sector ETFs, like the ARK Innovation Fund ($ARKK) or the O\u2019Shares Global Internet Giants Fund ($OGIG).\n\nOne of my favorites is ARKK, as they focus on disruptive innovation and change. So, for example, if something like this was to resonate with you, looking into their top holdings will give you some insight on what kinds of companies you\u2019d need to do research on to gain exposure to this particular strategy. At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of ARKK are:\n\n1. Tesla, Inc ($TSLA)\n2. Teladoc Health, Inc. ($TDOC)\n3. Roku, Inc. ($ROKU)\n4. Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)\n5. Square, Inc. ($SQ)\n6. Shopify, Inc ($SHOP)\n7. Spotify Technology SA ($SPOT)\n8. Twilio, Inc (TWLO)\n9. Coinbase Global, Inc ($COIN)\n10. Unity Software, Inc ($U)\n\nHopefully looking into index funds or ETFs like the ones listed above help spark curiosity and the urge to build on your own knowledge!\n\n**Invest in Things You Understand (Personal, Business)**\n\nAnother piece of advice I like to give people is to only invest in areas of the market you understand. For example, if I see a sector like biotech or cybersecurity shoot up 50% in the last three months, but I don\u2019t really understand how this industry works, don\u2019t put your money in it. Simple as that. If the whole stock market started to fall, these will be the easiest to target as a potential sell because you don\u2019t understand the industry or the company at all. Your conviction on the stock is low so incentive to hold onto it for the long term is also low.\n\nFor me, I\u2019m a big gamer and I understand the industry well. To compare it to the previous example above, I can take those companies and further extrapolate to build upon my research using my existing knowledge. As a result, I\u2019m aware that gaming consoles use chips from Intel ($INTC), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), as well as GPU processors from Nvidia ($NVDA). Many video games are developed on software applications like Unity ($U). I\u2019m also aware that a large population of gamers and gaming companies come from Asia and Europe, therefore I can look into stocks like Ubisoft ($UBI), Capcom ($CCOEF), or even Tencent Holdings ($TCEHY). What about gaming accessories from Corsair ($CRSR) or Logitech ($LOGI)? And let\u2019s not forget about Gamestop ($GME)!\n\nAnother great way to leverage your knowledge is to look at your workplace and how the business is structured from within. Does your company utilize products or services from other companies? If you work at a software company, perhaps you use Cisco ($CSCO) or Ciena ($CIEN) for your networking. If your company uses customer or sales support, you may be using something like Salesforce ($CRM), Twilio ($TWLO), or Zendesk ($ZEN). To optimize your business, your company may also be leveraging cybersecurity services like Palo Alto ($PALO), Okta ($OKTA), or Crowdstrike ($CRWD). By looking within your own workplace, you\u2019ll be able to do a bit of deeper digging to find stocks that services businesses and aren\u2019t as customer facing.\n\nUnderstanding an industry well allows you to build your conviction in that industry. By fully grasping the ins and outs, you\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re invested in. This prevents panicking or selling if you suddenly see a red day, because you know what the company is fundamentally and potentially capable of. It also allows you to get invested in the companies you\u2019re buying, ultimately feeling like a small owner of the company, which is exactly what the function of stocks are.\n\n**Diversify your Portfolio**\n\nSo now, you\u2019ve done a bit of research and found a ton of stocks you might potentially invest in. Now what? Well, now is where you want to think about risk management and portfolio diversity.\n\nFrom Investopedia, diversification is a \u201crisk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\u201d\n\nHow do I know what\u2019s diversified enough? Great question, but that\u2019s up to your personal risk tolerance. Try not to allocate all your stocks into one single sector or area of the market. By broadening out in sector (tech, industrial), subsector (5G, banks), geography (US, Asia, Europe), market cap (large, medium, small), and more, you can feel comfortable and confident with your investments. The last thing you want to be doing is checking your stocks every minute and wondering if you should buy more or sell it off. Also consider the timeline of your allocations. The majority of my portfolio is in long-term investments (3+ years), but I do have a small portion of my portfolio allocated to mid-term and momentum investments (less than two years), such as options and swing trading. It\u2019s up to each individual investor to determine these allocations and stay committed to knowing when to change your allocation based on your time horizon.\n\nConsider this portfolio of $10000 dollars: (Stock, dollar amount\\[%\\], sector/subsector/geography/market cap)\n\n* Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA - $1000 (10%) - Tech / EV / USA / Large\n* Alibaba Group ($BABA) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / E-Commerce / ASIA / Large\n* Bank of America ($BAC) - $1000 (10%) - Financials / Banking / USA / Large\n* GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Pharma / EU / Large\n* Brookfield Renewable ($BEP)- $1000 (10%) - Energy / Renewable / CAN / Large\n* Papa John\u2019s Int. ($PZZA)- $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Consumer/ USA / Mid\n* Ubisoft Entertainment ($UBI) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / Gaming / EU / Mid\n* Barrick Gold ($GOLD) - $1000 (10%) - Industrials / Mining / CAN / Mid\n* Aurora Cannabis ($ACB) - $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Cannabis / CAN / Small\n* Nano-X Imaging ($NNOX) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Telehealth / Israel / Small\n\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve been able to allocate into many different sectors, subsectors, geographies, and market caps. If one of these companies were to disappear tomorrow, we\u2019d still have 90% of our portfolio remaining.\n\nOf our mock portfolio, our sector allocation is the following: 30% Technology, 20% Consumer, 20% Health, and 10% each in Financials, Energy, and Industrials. Our subsector allocation is fully diversified in 10 subsectors of the market: Electric Vehicles, E-Commerce, Banking, Pharma, Renewable Energy, Consumer, Gaming, Mining, Cannabis, and Telehealth. In terms of geography, our allocation is the following: 30% USA, 30% Canada, 20% Europe, 10% Asia, and 10% Israel. With our market cap, our allocation is the following: 50% large, 30% mid, and 20% small. As you can see, this portfolio is well diversified in terms of sector, subsector, region, and market cap. These allocations will ultimately be up to you, as you will be in control of your portfolio.\n\n**Now You\u2019re Ready!**\n\nAnd that\u2019s it, we\u2019ve learned how to find stocks by looking at your surroundings using your own knowledge from your personal and work life and now you understand how to properly diversify a portfolio based on your own risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\n**Mainstreet**\n\nThis article is part of a series of articles aimed at assisting investors to take control of their wealth on Mainstreet.

The company also cited Microsoft\u2019s strong privacy protections.\n\nBackground: Netflix first publicly introduced the idea of adding a lower-priced ad-supported plan back in April.

It has actually been with us for quite a while now. And while it has tremendous market growth potential, at this point it seems like the good companies are already well established and over priced. But rest assured, there are still a couple of hidden gems out there that are only at the very beginning of their business evolution. Luckily, they also hold great potential for becoming serious disruptors and make innovative use of the IoT. \n\nThe IoT (internet of things) is simply a fancy name referring to online networks of devices that are connected to the internet and are communicating with other devices in the same network via connections to data centres. Think of smart light bulbs that you can turn on using a phone app or a smart house where you can control lights, music, locks, etc. online. These are all examples of IoT based developments. \n\nMore recently, new IoT companies are moving away from just focusing on connectivity and go further into application development, platform hosting and other services. With innovation growing, the IoT sector attracted nearly $20B last year and new startups are popping by everywhere and in 2020 attracted around 70% of total investments in IoT. Just in 2020, the IoT market grew by 20% (currently estimated at $300B) and this trend is projected to continue with a 25% CAGR in the next 5-7 years. And with market projections this positive, I\u2019ve done some digging to try and find some of these companies that I believe are still undervalued and hold the potential to double down fast. \n\n[Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) (NASDAQ: ALRM) \n\nFounded in 2000, [Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) develops cloud-based home or business security systems that are already used in millions of homes across the US and Canada. The system enables users to control their home or business devices (security cameras, lights, locks, air conditioning, etc.) through an internet based app. Alarm provides customers with its SaaS software and currently has over 100M devices connected to its data servers. In the past two years, Alarm also broadened its connectivity to include cars, cameras and water valves. \n\nALRM\u2019s market cap is currently valued at $4.1B with a share price ranging between $73-108 and an average volume of 188K. In terms of stock price action, the past 3 weeks has seen a modest 2.2% increase. While this seems to be a minor share price increase, market projections are highly positive for smart home security and ALRM\u2019s connectivity seems to provide a solid starting point.    \n\nT42 (AIM:TRAC)\n\nSimilarly to what Alarm is doing with house security, T42 is providing security solutions to the maritime shipping industry, which is currently lagging far behind what cutting-edge tech can offer. In a bid to address this market gap enter T42, an IoT, satellite-based technology company that provides tracking solutions for maritime shipping containers. T42 develops and manufactures a state-of -the-art smart lock that monitors containers and transmits real time data about security hazards to clients. T42\u2019s lock provides real time data and alerts (saved on the company\u2019s cloud server), monitoring containers\u2019 location, humidity levels, temperature, impacts, door openings etc. \n\nT42 is still in its early stages as a company, with a market cap of $8.6M GBP average volume estimated at 350K. Last week, T42 announced a $40M deal with Latin American ports which led to a 100% jump in share price jumping within a single trading session. And while T42 is still a new player in the field of IoT, its market projections are also highly positive and seeing deals starting to flow in sets it on a great course.  \n\nOther than ALRM and TRAC, there seems to be an analyst consensus about larger companies such as Cisco (CSCO), Amazon (AMZN) and Garmin (GRMN). I still need to do my proper DD on the large caps ones, but for those of you interested in some innovative IoT small caps, ALRM and TRAC have the potential to solidify as future security leaders each in its own field. I\u2019ll keep an eye out, hope you will too. I\u2019m not an adviser of course, so make sure to do your own research. Happy holidays!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 0}]}

(WKHS)** can be found in a similar setup to the **Volkswagen (VWAGY)** Short Squeeze of \u201808.\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know, **Volkswagen (VWAGY)** had one of the largest, most costly, and unforeseeable short squeezes in history. From a starting price of **\u20ac210.85 ($249.83)** to **\u20ac1005 ($1,190.69)** in less than two days, briefly making it the most valuable company in the world...\n\nNow let\u2019s try to enhance this perspective, in 2008 we were in the midst of what was known as *The Great Recession.* The worst financial disaster since *The Great Depression.* The World Equity Markets were in a progressively worsening situation across 2008. For example, two of the largest single day percentage drops in the **S&amp;P 500 INDEX** were in 2008. **1)** *10/15/08*: -9.04% **2)** *12/01/08:* \\-8.93%.\n\nIn 2008 the auto industry as a whole was in a rough state because it is a *Cyclical Stock,* so it moves depending on economic confidence. So, when the state of the economy is \u201cgood\u201d it goes up, when the state of the economy is \u201cbad\u201d it generally goes down. Of course, in a financial crisis people are not buying cars because they have to be conservative with their money and put food on the table knowing there is so much uncertainty within the economy. With this consistent drop of the auto industry, it turned big auto companies in the world that are on every stock exchange into sexy, attractive short candidates. With that being said, of course **Volkswagen** was one of those candidates.\u00a0\n\n**Volkswagen** at the time, was in some pretty serious debt, but consistently reported quarterly growth. With consistent earnings in a troubling time, **Volkswagen** managed to keep the stock price around **\u20ac300 ($355).**\n\n*Ten years ago, amidst the worst financial crises since the Great Depression, the American auto industry almost died. By Fall 2008, the \u201cBig Three\u201d US car companies of General Motors, Chrysler, and Ford faced potential insolvency, and without swift government intervention, their futures were in doubt.* \\- **Business Insider**\n\n**General Motors (GM)** was the biggest automaker in the world for about 72 years which they then had to file for bankruptcy on June 1, 2009. This is just perspective as to how bad the auto industry was in 2008, now I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s just as bad in 2021 but let me put the pieces together as to why this relates to **Workhorse.**\n\nThe downfall of the auto industry seemed like a no-brainer to short sellers to make boatloads of cash from struggling companies that were on the verge of bankruptcy. It was looked at as an \u201ceasy win\u201d, \u201ceasy money.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s profit off of it, let\u2019s short these companies!\u201d\u00a0\n\nLike I said earlier the auto industry was getting wrecked, so you can only imagine how luxury car companies are doing in this financial crisis as well. **Porsche** was fighting bankruptcy, just like every other car company was in 2008. Who the hell is buying a Porsche in a recession? Prior to 2008, **Porsche** was already a shareholder in **Volkswagen,** and as 2008 progressed, **Porsche** cleverly increased their holdings in **Volkswagen. Porsche** had increased their position to **30%,** then **44%** in *October 2008.* **Porsche** was holding **44%** in shareholder equity, but they also held Options for an additional **30%,** which gives a total of **74%** of **Volkswagen** shares. Very clever move\u2026\n\nIt was estimated that the *short interest* in Volkswagen was only **12.80%.** In today\u2019s market that doesn\u2019t seem too noteworthy (Workhorse\u2019s *Short Interest*: **39%**). Now, since **Porsche** owned practically 75% of **Volkswagen** share equity, it went from the market assuming that there is an available *Float* of **45%** to all of a sudden realizing there is a *Float* of not even **%1** of outstanding shares.\u00a0\n\n*With more than 70% of Volkswagen stock controlled by Porsche, short sellers realized there was nothing available to cover bearish bets. There was no stock float. All, or most, of Volkswagen shares were accounted for. The door shorts had to run through to exit their positions turned out to be microscopic.* ***-\u00a0 Baaron\u2019s***\n\nWhen there is such little *Float* available on the market, when people are expecting there to be so much MORE *Float* then there initially is, it creates a Supply and Demand issue. And that\u2019s exactly what **Porsche** knew was going to happen, a Supply and Demand issue. All of the short sellers needed to immediately \u2018Buy to Close\u2019 their positions in **Volkswagen.** Millions of shares worth of **Volkswagen** needed to be purchased but there were just not enough shares to be issued out and sold. When there is a ton of demand, very little supply, the price of the supply inflates like crazy. And that inevitably became the **Volkswagen** Short Squeeze of \u201808.\n\nOver the span of this historical short squeeze the price of **Volkswagen** ended up breaking **\u20ac1005 ($1,190.69).** In the midst of the greatest financial crisis in the last 50 years, **Volkswagen** (very briefly) became the most valuable company in the entire world. That is the potential of a well engineered short squeeze\u2026\u00a0\n\n**Porsche**, the Hedge Fund that also makes cars, made 30 billion dollars in a few *short* weeks. (Pun intended)\u00a0\n\nNow, how does this relate to **Workhorse**?\n\nLet me put this in perspective\u2026\n\n**Volkwagen\u2019s Short Interest:** *12.80%*\n\n**Workhorse\u2019s Short Interest:** *39%*\n\n**Workhorse\u2019s Float:** *115 Million*\n\n**Workhorse\u2019s Outstanding Shares:** *123 Million* \n\nThe *Short Interest* for Workhorse is 3x greater than **Volkwagen\u2019s** Short Interest was in 2008, the main message here is to **OWN THE FLOAT!!!**\n\n**IF WE OWN THE FLOAT, WE CAN SQUEEZE THIS LEMON!!!**\n\nIt is better to buy shares than call options and I know we all want to print tendies, but owning and not selling the *Float* will be a better scenario for all of us, so we aren\u2019t YOLOing \u2018out of the money\u2019 call options to donate our cash to Wall Street or Robinhood. In order for us to make this horse gallop, we must own the float, let **Porsche** be a great reminder that retail investors can have just as much of an impact on a specified stock than any hedge fund can.\u00a0\n\nLET\u2019S SQUEEZE THIS LEMON!!! THIS HORSE WILL SOON GALLOP!!!\n\n**WORKHORSE FOR THE WIN!!!**"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 0}]}

However, even seasoned investors can find some use out of this by getting back to the basics. This quick guide isn't meant to focus on financial metrics, but in an effort to explore companies based on the world around us.\n\nPreface: This is directed for individuals that are just starting to invest, in hopes of empowering them to continue to grow upon the knowledge they learn on in this post! This is also a post to help highlight a new social investing platform I've been building called [Mainstreet](https://mainstreetportfolio.com/) (currently in beta) that helps you invest with your friends, track your portfolios, and build communities with one another. Happy investing!\n\n**How To Find Stocks (for the Normal Investor)**\n\nOne of the most common questions I get when talking to someone just getting into investing, is something along the lines of \u201cWhich stocks are good?\u201d or \u201cHow do I find stocks to invest in?\u201d. Some of the reasons individuals choose not to invest is due to the \u201clack of knowledge\u201d or perhaps they are \u201cintimidated by the market\u201d. These are all valid reasons to not invest, but I feel like by providing the education and resources to learn about these topics in an easy and digestible manner will help people overcome these barriers and feel empowered to take control of their wealth, whether it\u2019s through real estate, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll dive into some of the strategies and methods I used to help gain knowledge and insight when investing in the stock market. Keep in mind this is not the definitive guide, but it\u2019s steps that I took to help me become more financially literate about the stock market. Everyone\u2019s path to financial education is different and unique and this is only meant to provide a different perspective for someone just starting out.\n\n**Pay Attention to the World Around You**\n\nThe first thing I usually tell people is, start to observe the world around you and the businesses that are close to your network. You\u2019ll easily be able to find many companies if you start to shift your mindset and look at how the world functions.\n\nFirst, look at what kind of products or services you consume. Do you need to get your fix of vanilla latte at Starbucks ($SBUX) in the morning? More of a fast food person? Let\u2019s look at McDonalds ($MCD), Chipotle ($CMG), Shake Shack ($SHAK), or Restaurant Brands International ($QSR). Are you a hardcore gamer? Well, I\u2019m sure one of your games or consoles comes from Sony ($SNE), Nintendo ($NTDOY), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), or Microsoft ($MSFT). Or maybe you\u2019ve been working from home? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had to buy some products from Amazon ($AMZN) or Wayfair ($W) to spruce up your office space. You\u2019re probably also using things like Zoom ($ZM), Google Drive ($GOOG or $GOOGL), or Slack to keep yourself productive during the day.\n\n**Build a Watchlist**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got the brain working a little, it\u2019s important to start building a watchlist of all the stocks you\u2019ve thought of. You can use your broker watchlist tool, or even an app like Yahoo Finance, WeBull, etc. Sort them in a way that works for you, whether it\u2019s by sector (financial, tech, industrials), subsector (gaming, oil, e-commerce), or even by priority (Watchlist Tier 1, Watchlist Tier 2, etc.)\n\nOrganization is key when building your watchlist. You\u2019ll want to have them organized because it\u2019ll help you get a quick glance of what\u2019s happening in the market at any given time. By checking on the stocks you\u2019ve added to your watchlist periodically, you\u2019ll learn how they move according to catalysts (market news, earnings, etc) and be able to plan how and when you\u2019d like to invest in them.\n\n**Search within an Index Fund or ETF**\n\nA great way to search up companies is by looking at current index fund or ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) allocations. With index funds, you can look at the holdings of the S&amp;P500 (Top 500 American companies) or the Nasdaq 100 (Most active, largest 100 Nasdaq companies). At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of the S&amp;P500 are:\n\n1. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)\n2. Microsoft Corp ($MSFT)\n3. Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN)\n4. Facebook, Inc. ($FB)\n5. Alphabet Inc. Class A ($GOOGL)\n6. Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG)\n7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc ($BRK.B)\n8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ($JPM)\n9. Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA)\n10. Johnson &amp; Johnson ($JNJ)\n\nAnother way is to look into the holdings of an ETF. There are tons of ETFs out there that track indices like $SPY and $QQQ, which track the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, as well as more focused sector ETFs, like the ARK Innovation Fund ($ARKK) or the O\u2019Shares Global Internet Giants Fund ($OGIG).\n\nOne of my favorites is ARKK, as they focus on disruptive innovation and change. So, for example, if something like this was to resonate with you, looking into their top holdings will give you some insight on what kinds of companies you\u2019d need to do research on to gain exposure to this particular strategy. At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of ARKK are:\n\n1. Tesla, Inc ($TSLA)\n2. Teladoc Health, Inc. ($TDOC)\n3. Roku, Inc. ($ROKU)\n4. Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)\n5. Square, Inc. ($SQ)\n6. Shopify, Inc ($SHOP)\n7. Spotify Technology SA ($SPOT)\n8. Twilio, Inc (TWLO)\n9. Coinbase Global, Inc ($COIN)\n10. Unity Software, Inc ($U)\n\nHopefully looking into index funds or ETFs like the ones listed above help spark curiosity and the urge to build on your own knowledge!\n\n**Invest in Things You Understand (Personal, Business)**\n\nAnother piece of advice I like to give people is to only invest in areas of the market you understand. For example, if I see a sector like biotech or cybersecurity shoot up 50% in the last three months, but I don\u2019t really understand how this industry works, don\u2019t put your money in it. Simple as that. If the whole stock market started to fall, these will be the easiest to target as a potential sell because you don\u2019t understand the industry or the company at all. Your conviction on the stock is low so incentive to hold onto it for the long term is also low.\n\nFor me, I\u2019m a big gamer and I understand the industry well. To compare it to the previous example above, I can take those companies and further extrapolate to build upon my research using my existing knowledge. As a result, I\u2019m aware that gaming consoles use chips from Intel ($INTC), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), as well as GPU processors from Nvidia ($NVDA). Many video games are developed on software applications like Unity ($U). I\u2019m also aware that a large population of gamers and gaming companies come from Asia and Europe, therefore I can look into stocks like Ubisoft ($UBI), Capcom ($CCOEF), or even Tencent Holdings ($TCEHY). What about gaming accessories from Corsair ($CRSR) or Logitech ($LOGI)? And let\u2019s not forget about Gamestop ($GME)!\n\nAnother great way to leverage your knowledge is to look at your workplace and how the business is structured from within. Does your company utilize products or services from other companies? If you work at a software company, perhaps you use Cisco ($CSCO) or Ciena ($CIEN) for your networking. If your company uses customer or sales support, you may be using something like Salesforce ($CRM), Twilio ($TWLO), or Zendesk ($ZEN). To optimize your business, your company may also be leveraging cybersecurity services like Palo Alto ($PALO), Okta ($OKTA), or Crowdstrike ($CRWD). By looking within your own workplace, you\u2019ll be able to do a bit of deeper digging to find stocks that services businesses and aren\u2019t as customer facing.\n\nUnderstanding an industry well allows you to build your conviction in that industry. By fully grasping the ins and outs, you\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re invested in. This prevents panicking or selling if you suddenly see a red day, because you know what the company is fundamentally and potentially capable of. It also allows you to get invested in the companies you\u2019re buying, ultimately feeling like a small owner of the company, which is exactly what the function of stocks are.\n\n**Diversify your Portfolio**\n\nSo now, you\u2019ve done a bit of research and found a ton of stocks you might potentially invest in. Now what? Well, now is where you want to think about risk management and portfolio diversity.\n\nFrom Investopedia, diversification is a \u201crisk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\u201d\n\nHow do I know what\u2019s diversified enough? Great question, but that\u2019s up to your personal risk tolerance. Try not to allocate all your stocks into one single sector or area of the market. By broadening out in sector (tech, industrial), subsector (5G, banks), geography (US, Asia, Europe), market cap (large, medium, small), and more, you can feel comfortable and confident with your investments. The last thing you want to be doing is checking your stocks every minute and wondering if you should buy more or sell it off. Also consider the timeline of your allocations. The majority of my portfolio is in long-term investments (3+ years), but I do have a small portion of my portfolio allocated to mid-term and momentum investments (less than two years), such as options and swing trading. It\u2019s up to each individual investor to determine these allocations and stay committed to knowing when to change your allocation based on your time horizon.\n\nConsider this portfolio of $10000 dollars: (Stock, dollar amount\\[%\\], sector/subsector/geography/market cap)\n\n* Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA - $1000 (10%) - Tech / EV / USA / Large\n* Alibaba Group ($BABA) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / E-Commerce / ASIA / Large\n* Bank of America ($BAC) - $1000 (10%) - Financials / Banking / USA / Large\n* GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Pharma / EU / Large\n* Brookfield Renewable ($BEP)- $1000 (10%) - Energy / Renewable / CAN / Large\n* Papa John\u2019s Int. ($PZZA)- $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Consumer/ USA / Mid\n* Ubisoft Entertainment ($UBI) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / Gaming / EU / Mid\n* Barrick Gold ($GOLD) - $1000 (10%) - Industrials / Mining / CAN / Mid\n* Aurora Cannabis ($ACB) - $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Cannabis / CAN / Small\n* Nano-X Imaging ($NNOX) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Telehealth / Israel / Small\n\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve been able to allocate into many different sectors, subsectors, geographies, and market caps. If one of these companies were to disappear tomorrow, we\u2019d still have 90% of our portfolio remaining.\n\nOf our mock portfolio, our sector allocation is the following: 30% Technology, 20% Consumer, 20% Health, and 10% each in Financials, Energy, and Industrials. Our subsector allocation is fully diversified in 10 subsectors of the market: Electric Vehicles, E-Commerce, Banking, Pharma, Renewable Energy, Consumer, Gaming, Mining, Cannabis, and Telehealth. In terms of geography, our allocation is the following: 30% USA, 30% Canada, 20% Europe, 10% Asia, and 10% Israel. With our market cap, our allocation is the following: 50% large, 30% mid, and 20% small. As you can see, this portfolio is well diversified in terms of sector, subsector, region, and market cap. These allocations will ultimately be up to you, as you will be in control of your portfolio.\n\n**Now You\u2019re Ready!**\n\nAnd that\u2019s it, we\u2019ve learned how to find stocks by looking at your surroundings using your own knowledge from your personal and work life and now you understand how to properly diversify a portfolio based on your own risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\n**Mainstreet**\n\nThis article is part of a series of articles aimed at assisting investors to take control of their wealth on Mainstreet.

An investment\u2019s ESG score measures the sustainability of an investment in three specific categories: environmental, social and corporate governance.\n\nInvestors interested in environmental, social and governance issues often cite climate concerns as guiding their ESG investments.\n\nThey were rewarded during the market crash as oil prices cratered. In the first quarter, sustainability-focused funds held up better than the broader fund market during the initial bear market sell-off \u2013 driven in part by less exposure to fossil fuel energy.\n\nThat said, ESG goes beyond not buying petroleum companies; there's the \"S\" and the \"G\" parts, too, and those may take greater prominence as people focus on health care amid the pandemic and the social unrest triggered by systemic racism.\n\nThe global sustainable fund universe attracted $45.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020, versus an outflow of $384.7 billion from the overall fund universe. In the U.S. specifically, the research firm found that in the first quarter, flows into open-end and sustainable ETFs reached $10.5 billion, eclipsing the previous record set in 2019's fourth quarter.\n\nA June survey in 2020 from global investment manager Nuveen showed high-net-worth investors are starting to choose ESG for its outperformance, in addition to having a positive social impact, with 53% of respondents citing returns as their top reason to invest in ESG.\n\nAs such, it seems to be a wise choice to get started on an ESG portfolio. Here are some picks to get you started.\n\n***Coca-Cola (KO)***\n\nAs a mega-cap stock with a current market value around $250 billion, Coca-Cola has already partially recovered from the loss in sales due to the pandemic. Analysts suggest that by providing a dividend yield of approximately 3.1%, Coca-Cola makes the list of the top recovery stocks of 2021.\n\nMoreover, if you\u2019re looking for companies that strictly adhere to ESG policies, Coca-Cola has an AA rating from MSCI. The company performs exceptionally well when it comes to waste management, ensuring health and safety standards, and controlling the carbon footprint per product.\n\nThese attributes make it one of the leading ESG dividend stock companies in the beverage industry. Interestingly, only 15% have an AA rating from MSCI, while only 9% have a higher AAA rating.\n\n***Honeywell (HON)***\n\nHoneywell is an ESG-compliant company that shows high growth potential due to its share-price appreciation.\n\nThe Street predicts around 11% annual average growth for the company in the next few years, with a strong \u2018Buy\u2019 rating. Honeywell has consistently raised its dividends since 2014, going up from 45 cents per share to 95 cents last year.\n\nAs far as ESG compliance is concerned, Honeywell holds an AA rating from MSCI. Offering a dividend yield of 1.6%, Honeywell maintains its ESG rating among 14% of its industry peers, having the AA rating.\n\n***NVIDIA (NVDA)***\n\nThis is a well-known company producing graphics and video processing cards, remained unaffected by the pandemic. Analysts suggest that the company is bound to face the most prominent growth rate in the tech sector, surpassing artificial intelligence and auto technology. On the ESG end, NVIDIA is highly rated because of its mineral policy and effective corporate governance. The company uses rare minerals to build its chips and cards; therefore, it has a stringent policy against unethical procurement and mining of these minerals.\n\n***Chr. Hansen (CHYHY)***\n\nThe Danish human nutrition giant Chr. Hansen ranks high in ESG compliance due to its sustainable practices regarding food security and waste management. The company mainly produces bacteria that help curb the extended use of harmful pesticides while increasing crop yield at the same time.\n\nMoreover, Chr. Hansen has successfully developed an accounting system according to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. This helps the company assess the impact of each product and display the metrics to investors.\n\nThese extra measures place Chr. Hansen in the first place on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations List.\n\n***MBH Corporation (MBHCF)***\n\nMBH is a holding company actively building a portfolio of profitable, earnings accretive, debt-free small to medium enterprises (SME) that are expected to have a higher-than-normal growth profile as part of a larger organization. The company's operating model leaves management of the acquired companies to operate autonomously and fully accountable to develop and grow their businesses. As part of a larger organization, the acquired companies and in turn, MBH get the benefits of both worlds. This small holding company may have just started out, but it is pumping out revenue steadily and healthily and pays a 2% dividend. MBH Corporation has won five stars for their ESG credentials, getting into the top 1% of the nearly 2,000 businesses in the Support the Goals database. They have achieved this level of commitment through their work with inequality and climate goals. Support the Goals encourages businesses to take responsibility and the organisation expects companies 'to demonstrate how you support the world\u2019s most important action plan'.\n\n***NextEra Energy (NEE)***\n\nNextEra is the largest electric utility by market cap. Over the last few decades, the company has been consistently reducing its emissions through increased renewable energy use. Its CO2 emissions are 55% less than those of an average US utility. NextEra has now set an ambitious goal of reducing CO2 emissions, by 2025, by 67% from its 2005 base levels. This goal effectively means that absolute CO2 emissions would go down by 40% even while NextEra\u2019s energy production would double during that time. To its credit, the company last year received a best-in-class preparedness assessment by S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 ESG Evaluation. NextEra has, essentially, received the highest ranking given by S&amp;P to a company within the utility sector.\n\n***Microsoft (MSFT)***\n\nMicrosoft has taken the lead in its commitment towards carbon mitigation by becoming the first company among its peers to target \u201ccarbon negative\u201d status by 2030. It has created a $1 billion fund to reduce emissions and start clearing carbon. This ambitious commitment is unprecedented and sets Microsoft apart from its entire sector. Microsoft received the highest ESG rating of AAA from MSCI ESG Research in September 2019.\n\n***Prologis (PLD)***\n\nPrologis is a logistics-focused REIT with multiple \u201cfirst company to\u2026\u201d accomplishments in the ESG space. Prologis is the first real estate company to issue green bonds. It is also the first real estate company to be awarded the WELL certification by the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI). Additionally, Prologis is the first logistics company to receive approved SBTs or \u201cScience-Based Targets\u201d necessary to meet the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement of 2015. The company ranks highly on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World list and on the Investor\u2019s Business Daily (IBD) 50 Best ESG Companies list."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 1}]}

It has actually been with us for quite a while now. And while it has tremendous market growth potential, at this point it seems like the good companies are already well established and over priced. But rest assured, there are still a couple of hidden gems out there that are only at the very beginning of their business evolution. Luckily, they also hold great potential for becoming serious disruptors and make innovative use of the IoT. \n\nThe IoT (internet of things) is simply a fancy name referring to online networks of devices that are connected to the internet and are communicating with other devices in the same network via connections to data centres. Think of smart light bulbs that you can turn on using a phone app or a smart house where you can control lights, music, locks, etc. online. These are all examples of IoT based developments. \n\nMore recently, new IoT companies are moving away from just focusing on connectivity and go further into application development, platform hosting and other services. With innovation growing, the IoT sector attracted nearly $20B last year and new startups are popping by everywhere and in 2020 attracted around 70% of total investments in IoT. Just in 2020, the IoT market grew by 20% (currently estimated at $300B) and this trend is projected to continue with a 25% CAGR in the next 5-7 years. And with market projections this positive, I\u2019ve done some digging to try and find some of these companies that I believe are still undervalued and hold the potential to double down fast. \n\n[Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) (NASDAQ: ALRM) \n\nFounded in 2000, [Alarm.com](https://Alarm.com) develops cloud-based home or business security systems that are already used in millions of homes across the US and Canada. The system enables users to control their home or business devices (security cameras, lights, locks, air conditioning, etc.) through an internet based app. Alarm provides customers with its SaaS software and currently has over 100M devices connected to its data servers. In the past two years, Alarm also broadened its connectivity to include cars, cameras and water valves. \n\nALRM\u2019s market cap is currently valued at $4.1B with a share price ranging between $73-108 and an average volume of 188K. In terms of stock price action, the past 3 weeks has seen a modest 2.2% increase. While this seems to be a minor share price increase, market projections are highly positive for smart home security and ALRM\u2019s connectivity seems to provide a solid starting point.    \n\nT42 (AIM:TRAC)\n\nSimilarly to what Alarm is doing with house security, T42 is providing security solutions to the maritime shipping industry, which is currently lagging far behind what cutting-edge tech can offer. In a bid to address this market gap enter T42, an IoT, satellite-based technology company that provides tracking solutions for maritime shipping containers. T42 develops and manufactures a state-of -the-art smart lock that monitors containers and transmits real time data about security hazards to clients. T42\u2019s lock provides real time data and alerts (saved on the company\u2019s cloud server), monitoring containers\u2019 location, humidity levels, temperature, impacts, door openings etc. \n\nT42 is still in its early stages as a company, with a market cap of $8.6M GBP average volume estimated at 350K. Last week, T42 announced a $40M deal with Latin American ports which led to a 100% jump in share price jumping within a single trading session. And while T42 is still a new player in the field of IoT, its market projections are also highly positive and seeing deals starting to flow in sets it on a great course.  \n\nOther than ALRM and TRAC, there seems to be an analyst consensus about larger companies such as Cisco (CSCO), Amazon (AMZN) and Garmin (GRMN). I still need to do my proper DD on the large caps ones, but for those of you interested in some innovative IoT small caps, ALRM and TRAC have the potential to solidify as future security leaders each in its own field. I\u2019ll keep an eye out, hope you will too. I\u2019m not an adviser of course, so make sure to do your own research. Happy holidays!"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 0}]}

However, even seasoned investors can find some use out of this by getting back to the basics. This quick guide isn't meant to focus on financial metrics, but in an effort to explore companies based on the world around us.\n\nPreface: This is directed for individuals that are just starting to invest, in hopes of empowering them to continue to grow upon the knowledge they learn on in this post! This is also a post to help highlight a new social investing platform I've been building called [Mainstreet](https://mainstreetportfolio.com/) (currently in beta) that helps you invest with your friends, track your portfolios, and build communities with one another. Happy investing!\n\n**How To Find Stocks (for the Normal Investor)**\n\nOne of the most common questions I get when talking to someone just getting into investing, is something along the lines of \u201cWhich stocks are good?\u201d or \u201cHow do I find stocks to invest in?\u201d. Some of the reasons individuals choose not to invest is due to the \u201clack of knowledge\u201d or perhaps they are \u201cintimidated by the market\u201d. These are all valid reasons to not invest, but I feel like by providing the education and resources to learn about these topics in an easy and digestible manner will help people overcome these barriers and feel empowered to take control of their wealth, whether it\u2019s through real estate, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll dive into some of the strategies and methods I used to help gain knowledge and insight when investing in the stock market. Keep in mind this is not the definitive guide, but it\u2019s steps that I took to help me become more financially literate about the stock market. Everyone\u2019s path to financial education is different and unique and this is only meant to provide a different perspective for someone just starting out.\n\n**Pay Attention to the World Around You**\n\nThe first thing I usually tell people is, start to observe the world around you and the businesses that are close to your network. You\u2019ll easily be able to find many companies if you start to shift your mindset and look at how the world functions.\n\nFirst, look at what kind of products or services you consume. Do you need to get your fix of vanilla latte at Starbucks ($SBUX) in the morning? More of a fast food person? Let\u2019s look at McDonalds ($MCD), Chipotle ($CMG), Shake Shack ($SHAK), or Restaurant Brands International ($QSR). Are you a hardcore gamer? Well, I\u2019m sure one of your games or consoles comes from Sony ($SNE), Nintendo ($NTDOY), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), or Microsoft ($MSFT). Or maybe you\u2019ve been working from home? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had to buy some products from Amazon ($AMZN) or Wayfair ($W) to spruce up your office space. You\u2019re probably also using things like Zoom ($ZM), Google Drive ($GOOG or $GOOGL), or Slack to keep yourself productive during the day.\n\n**Build a Watchlist**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got the brain working a little, it\u2019s important to start building a watchlist of all the stocks you\u2019ve thought of. You can use your broker watchlist tool, or even an app like Yahoo Finance, WeBull, etc. Sort them in a way that works for you, whether it\u2019s by sector (financial, tech, industrials), subsector (gaming, oil, e-commerce), or even by priority (Watchlist Tier 1, Watchlist Tier 2, etc.)\n\nOrganization is key when building your watchlist. You\u2019ll want to have them organized because it\u2019ll help you get a quick glance of what\u2019s happening in the market at any given time. By checking on the stocks you\u2019ve added to your watchlist periodically, you\u2019ll learn how they move according to catalysts (market news, earnings, etc) and be able to plan how and when you\u2019d like to invest in them.\n\n**Search within an Index Fund or ETF**\n\nA great way to search up companies is by looking at current index fund or ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) allocations. With index funds, you can look at the holdings of the S&amp;P500 (Top 500 American companies) or the Nasdaq 100 (Most active, largest 100 Nasdaq companies). At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of the S&amp;P500 are:\n\n1. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)\n2. Microsoft Corp ($MSFT)\n3. Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN)\n4. Facebook, Inc. ($FB)\n5. Alphabet Inc. Class A ($GOOGL)\n6. Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG)\n7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc ($BRK.B)\n8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ($JPM)\n9. Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA)\n10. Johnson &amp; Johnson ($JNJ)\n\nAnother way is to look into the holdings of an ETF. There are tons of ETFs out there that track indices like $SPY and $QQQ, which track the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, as well as more focused sector ETFs, like the ARK Innovation Fund ($ARKK) or the O\u2019Shares Global Internet Giants Fund ($OGIG).\n\nOne of my favorites is ARKK, as they focus on disruptive innovation and change. So, for example, if something like this was to resonate with you, looking into their top holdings will give you some insight on what kinds of companies you\u2019d need to do research on to gain exposure to this particular strategy. At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of ARKK are:\n\n1. Tesla, Inc ($TSLA)\n2. Teladoc Health, Inc. ($TDOC)\n3. Roku, Inc. ($ROKU)\n4. Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)\n5. Square, Inc. ($SQ)\n6. Shopify, Inc ($SHOP)\n7. Spotify Technology SA ($SPOT)\n8. Twilio, Inc (TWLO)\n9. Coinbase Global, Inc ($COIN)\n10. Unity Software, Inc ($U)\n\nHopefully looking into index funds or ETFs like the ones listed above help spark curiosity and the urge to build on your own knowledge!\n\n**Invest in Things You Understand (Personal, Business)**\n\nAnother piece of advice I like to give people is to only invest in areas of the market you understand. For example, if I see a sector like biotech or cybersecurity shoot up 50% in the last three months, but I don\u2019t really understand how this industry works, don\u2019t put your money in it. Simple as that. If the whole stock market started to fall, these will be the easiest to target as a potential sell because you don\u2019t understand the industry or the company at all. Your conviction on the stock is low so incentive to hold onto it for the long term is also low.\n\nFor me, I\u2019m a big gamer and I understand the industry well. To compare it to the previous example above, I can take those companies and further extrapolate to build upon my research using my existing knowledge. As a result, I\u2019m aware that gaming consoles use chips from Intel ($INTC), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), as well as GPU processors from Nvidia ($NVDA). Many video games are developed on software applications like Unity ($U). I\u2019m also aware that a large population of gamers and gaming companies come from Asia and Europe, therefore I can look into stocks like Ubisoft ($UBI), Capcom ($CCOEF), or even Tencent Holdings ($TCEHY). What about gaming accessories from Corsair ($CRSR) or Logitech ($LOGI)? And let\u2019s not forget about Gamestop ($GME)!\n\nAnother great way to leverage your knowledge is to look at your workplace and how the business is structured from within. Does your company utilize products or services from other companies? If you work at a software company, perhaps you use Cisco ($CSCO) or Ciena ($CIEN) for your networking. If your company uses customer or sales support, you may be using something like Salesforce ($CRM), Twilio ($TWLO), or Zendesk ($ZEN). To optimize your business, your company may also be leveraging cybersecurity services like Palo Alto ($PALO), Okta ($OKTA), or Crowdstrike ($CRWD). By looking within your own workplace, you\u2019ll be able to do a bit of deeper digging to find stocks that services businesses and aren\u2019t as customer facing.\n\nUnderstanding an industry well allows you to build your conviction in that industry. By fully grasping the ins and outs, you\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re invested in. This prevents panicking or selling if you suddenly see a red day, because you know what the company is fundamentally and potentially capable of. It also allows you to get invested in the companies you\u2019re buying, ultimately feeling like a small owner of the company, which is exactly what the function of stocks are.\n\n**Diversify your Portfolio**\n\nSo now, you\u2019ve done a bit of research and found a ton of stocks you might potentially invest in. Now what? Well, now is where you want to think about risk management and portfolio diversity.\n\nFrom Investopedia, diversification is a \u201crisk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\u201d\n\nHow do I know what\u2019s diversified enough? Great question, but that\u2019s up to your personal risk tolerance. Try not to allocate all your stocks into one single sector or area of the market. By broadening out in sector (tech, industrial), subsector (5G, banks), geography (US, Asia, Europe), market cap (large, medium, small), and more, you can feel comfortable and confident with your investments. The last thing you want to be doing is checking your stocks every minute and wondering if you should buy more or sell it off. Also consider the timeline of your allocations. The majority of my portfolio is in long-term investments (3+ years), but I do have a small portion of my portfolio allocated to mid-term and momentum investments (less than two years), such as options and swing trading. It\u2019s up to each individual investor to determine these allocations and stay committed to knowing when to change your allocation based on your time horizon.\n\nConsider this portfolio of $10000 dollars: (Stock, dollar amount\\[%\\], sector/subsector/geography/market cap)\n\n* Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA - $1000 (10%) - Tech / EV / USA / Large\n* Alibaba Group ($BABA) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / E-Commerce / ASIA / Large\n* Bank of America ($BAC) - $1000 (10%) - Financials / Banking / USA / Large\n* GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Pharma / EU / Large\n* Brookfield Renewable ($BEP)- $1000 (10%) - Energy / Renewable / CAN / Large\n* Papa John\u2019s Int. ($PZZA)- $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Consumer/ USA / Mid\n* Ubisoft Entertainment ($UBI) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / Gaming / EU / Mid\n* Barrick Gold ($GOLD) - $1000 (10%) - Industrials / Mining / CAN / Mid\n* Aurora Cannabis ($ACB) - $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Cannabis / CAN / Small\n* Nano-X Imaging ($NNOX) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Telehealth / Israel / Small\n\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve been able to allocate into many different sectors, subsectors, geographies, and market caps. If one of these companies were to disappear tomorrow, we\u2019d still have 90% of our portfolio remaining.\n\nOf our mock portfolio, our sector allocation is the following: 30% Technology, 20% Consumer, 20% Health, and 10% each in Financials, Energy, and Industrials. Our subsector allocation is fully diversified in 10 subsectors of the market: Electric Vehicles, E-Commerce, Banking, Pharma, Renewable Energy, Consumer, Gaming, Mining, Cannabis, and Telehealth. In terms of geography, our allocation is the following: 30% USA, 30% Canada, 20% Europe, 10% Asia, and 10% Israel. With our market cap, our allocation is the following: 50% large, 30% mid, and 20% small. As you can see, this portfolio is well diversified in terms of sector, subsector, region, and market cap. These allocations will ultimately be up to you, as you will be in control of your portfolio.\n\n**Now You\u2019re Ready!**\n\nAnd that\u2019s it, we\u2019ve learned how to find stocks by looking at your surroundings using your own knowledge from your personal and work life and now you understand how to properly diversify a portfolio based on your own risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\n**Mainstreet**\n\nThis article is part of a series of articles aimed at assisting investors to take control of their wealth on Mainstreet.

In addition, As medical school faculty, If I  can't figure it out, I know who to ask.\n2. I started investing (profitably) before most of you were born.\n\nWhy  flex?

With that said, once more, listen up!\n\n**The Pickle:**\n\nYou  youngins haven't noticed, but Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of  death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. The kicker is,  there is NO effective treatment.\n\nThe  FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm. This drug has  significant adverse events. The risk of brain swelling requires serial  Brain MRIs. It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV  infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k. Most incredible is  that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate  trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make  later).\n\nAgain, for emphasis, the  FDA still approved it because the need is that severe. President Biden  recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation  over a trillion dollars.\n\n**The Fix: $SAVA**\n\nCassava  Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive  function in its CMS trial. The degree and duration of improvement have  NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic.  It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that  behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it  doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the  discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.\n\nYes,  we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc. A genuine  criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased  critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the  usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives  conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the  ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.\n\nWithout  getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere  criticisms is Phase 3 trials. There is no valid argument against this  statement. This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use  absolute phrases. If you take away only one point from this article,  then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start  early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more  about him later). Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after  the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also  threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy. Be angry,  fellow apes, be angry. Im just getting started, BTW.\n\nDo  market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal?  They do. That is why the stock price went from &lt; $1 to an ATH of  $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my  family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the  first place.\n\n**The Villan and His Massacre:**\n\nJordan  Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a \"Citizens Petition.\"  A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit)  out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical  to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed  another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.\n\nEssentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second,  sold their shares. SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the  making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog ([https://ad-science.org/](https://ad-science.org/)),  Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it  biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.\n\n1. Jordan  Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that  patients are literally dying as they wait. WTF!? Why, why why?? If you  aren't angry, somethings wrong with you. JT states he is concerned for  patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there  is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected,  JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly.  In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did  JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that  is the \\*only\\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is  safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall  continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these  petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is  horrendous (3% success rate)? Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who  uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD  in its purest form.\n2. Then  why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous  document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe  even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my  position by 30%. With that said, Im not surprised the masses started  selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent,  it's an \\*opportunity\\*\u2014a second chance to buy the stock on clearance.\n\n**The Financials:**\n\n$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue.\n\nFifty  million patients are suffering from AD globally. 6 million of those  patients reside in the US. Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American  market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs  $20k annually, just a bit over a third the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's  soon to fail drug):\n\n1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000\n\nThat  calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up  as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment  options). The current stock price is $50. The overly conservative  valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750\n\nThe above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia.\n\n**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**\n\nIf  you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading  causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a  hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of  death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment.  Thats devastating for patients, but families? It's not uncommon for  families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they \"can't  handle it anymore.\" This market is massive and unaddressed! Severely,  painfully, and gravely unaddressed.\n\nI  have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires  (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process. JT is only the  face of this farce. Behind him are many short positions making a 100  million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their  short-term gain. There is something far more concerning.\n\n**The Plot Thickens:**\n\nWhat  I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or  short-term price action. There is something much more sinister. Biogen  has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved. Now it  is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a  problem:\n\nFDA advisory committee  voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then  saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently,  a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and  Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to  support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and  Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the  country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's  AD drug. This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you  to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no  other therapy on the market. Well, what happens if a new, more effective  medication shows up?\n\n**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**\n\nBack  to our Villian JT. JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the  initial \"Citizens Patetion\") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works. Why? I  speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous  whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried  about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in  profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is  more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer. There is  little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less. When that  happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug. Biogen already  has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to  rejuvenate the companies earnings. Then expediently and as expected,  Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.\n\nI  believe that is the root issue. Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become  furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam! A group of us have  gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to  investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).\n\n**Short term price action:**\n\n1. Im  expecting the SP to bounce. After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a  perfect overreaction play. If you dont know what Im talking about, you  can look up \"overreaction with reversion to the mean.\"\n2. Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within \"weeks to months.\"\n3. Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks. (\"Soon\" per Remi)\n4. Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.\n\n\\#SAVA's  float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted  with utilization of &gt;90%. It'll take very little to make SAVA move,  big. Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.\n\nI  have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on  SAVA. My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!). I'll  finish with one last piece of advice. Over 19 years of investing, my  most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading  and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment  by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further  propagated by \"experts\" tweeting and commenting with their hidden  agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual  published results, but apparently, her opinion counts? Comments of her  blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical  vernacular to cause panic.

Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical  details are fooling many. DFV saw something well before masses, and he  was paid handsomely for it.\n\nIf my  opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen,  then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in  with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs.  a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.\n\nI am long.

The risk of brain swelling requires serial  Brain MRIs. It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV  infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k. Most incredible is  that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate  trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make  later).\n\nAgain, for emphasis, the  FDA still approved it because the need is that severe. President Biden  recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation  over a trillion dollars.\n\n**The Fix: $SAVA**\n\nCassava  Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive  function in its CMS trial. The degree and duration of improvement have  NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic.  It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that  behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it  doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the  discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.\n\nYes,  we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc. A genuine  criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased  critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the  usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives  conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the  ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.\n\nWithout  getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere  criticisms is Phase 3 trials. There is no valid argument against this  statement. This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use  absolute phrases. If you take away only one point from this article,  then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start  early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more  about him later). Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after  the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also  threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy. Be angry,  fellow apes, be angry. Im just getting started, BTW.\n\nDo  market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal?  They do. That is why the stock price went from &lt; $1 to an ATH of  $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my  family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the  first place.\n\n**The Villan and His Massacre:**\n\nJordan  Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a \"Citizens Petition.\"  A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit)  out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical  to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed  another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.\n\nEssentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second,  sold their shares. SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the  making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog ([https://ad-science.org/](https://ad-science.org/)),  Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it  biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.\n\n1. Jordan  Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that  patients are literally dying as they wait. WTF!? Why, why why?? If you  aren't angry, somethings wrong with you. JT states he is concerned for  patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there  is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected,  JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly.  In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did  JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that  is the \\*only\\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is  safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall  continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these  petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is  horrendous (3% success rate)? Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who  uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD  in its purest form.\n2. Then  why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous  document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe  even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my  position by 30%. With that said, Im not surprised the masses started  selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent,  it's an \\*opportunity\\*\u2014a second chance to buy the stock on clearance.\n\n**The Financials:**\n\n$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue.\n\nFifty  million patients are suffering from AD globally. 6 million of those  patients reside in the US. Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American  market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs  $20k annually, just a bit over a third the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's  soon to fail drug):\n\n1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000\n\nThat  calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up  as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment  options). The current stock price is $50. The overly conservative  valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750\n\nThe above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia.\n\n**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**\n\nIf  you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading  causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a  hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of  death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment.  Thats devastating for patients, but families? It's not uncommon for  families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they \"can't  handle it anymore.\" This market is massive and unaddressed! Severely,  painfully, and gravely unaddressed.\n\nI  have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires  (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process. JT is only the  face of this farce. Behind him are many short positions making a 100  million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their  short-term gain. There is something far more concerning.\n\n**The Plot Thickens:**\n\nWhat  I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or  short-term price action. There is something much more sinister. Biogen  has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved. Now it  is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a  problem:\n\nFDA advisory committee  voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then  saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently,  a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and  Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to  support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and  Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the  country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's  AD drug. This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you  to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no  other therapy on the market. Well, what happens if a new, more effective  medication shows up?\n\n**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**\n\nBack  to our Villian JT. JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the  initial \"Citizens Patetion\") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works. Why? I  speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous  whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried  about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in  profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is  more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer. There is  little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less. When that  happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug. Biogen already  has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to  rejuvenate the companies earnings. Then expediently and as expected,  Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.\n\nI  believe that is the root issue. Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become  furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam! A group of us have  gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to  investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).\n\n**Short term price action:**\n\n1. Im  expecting the SP to bounce. After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a  perfect overreaction play. If you dont know what Im talking about, you  can look up \"overreaction with reversion to the mean.\"\n2. Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within \"weeks to months.\"\n3. Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks. (\"Soon\" per Remi)\n4. Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.\n\n\\#SAVA's  float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted  with utilization of &gt;90%. It'll take very little to make SAVA move,  big. Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.\n\nI  have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on  SAVA. My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!). I'll  finish with one last piece of advice. Over 19 years of investing, my  most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading  and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment  by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further  propagated by \"experts\" tweeting and commenting with their hidden  agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual  published results, but apparently, her opinion counts? Comments of her  blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical  vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, \"oh, he sounds  smart, so he must be right.\" or \"That sounds complicated, he must be on  to something.\" In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical  details are fooling many. DFV saw something well before masses, and he  was paid handsomely for it.\n\nIf my  opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen,  then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in  with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs.  a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.\n\nI am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD before making any decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": -1}]}

He had the floor, and because of the political pressures on him to acknowledge inflation so that the American people see the government is on the case, the market really wanted to see how he would navigate between his truest analysis that inflation is** \u201c***transitory\u201d*** **and Biden's need for the FED to take a hawkish stance on raging consumer prices, housing, and rent.**\n\nTo make it even harder on Powell, the PPI (Producer Price Index) came out a couple of days beforehand, it was the highest in 40 years!\n\n**Businesses are complaining, both big and small, about the insane supply chain constraints, labor shortages, costs for raw materials, and services they need being delayed.**\n\nLife on the ground for small businesses is quite unbearable, and the FED knows that the people are suffering.\n\n**In our opinion, the Delta variant caused many problems that were largely behind us to resurface.**\n\nAs we enter 2022 and the fears over Omicron (by the people that still get their news from a mainstream source) subside because thousands of scientists are saying it spreads quickly but is extremely mild, the working class is going back to the labor pool and the shortages and unionizing we've witnessed are subsiding!\n\n**Even lower unemployment, coupled with lower consumer demand, will shape 2022 as a year of amazing discounts, so be ready to shop at steep sales.**\n\n**Now, let's talk about what Powell said in response to all of this.**\n\n**WHAT DID POWELL SAY?**\n\nMy takeaways are these:\n\n1. Biden pushed Powell into retiring the word \"transitory\" by threatening to fire him if he doesn't change his public stance about it. Biden wanted Powell to appear as if he were fighting inflation.\n2. The FED still clearly believes inflation is temporary since it forecasts that it will halve by the end of 2022.\n3. On news of this, both precious metals and stocks reacted well and were further convinced of their bullish direction when Powell said that inflation is under control so they won't be too aggressive, eliminating the fear that rate hikes will lead to a slowdown, market crash, recession, or all of the above. **A multi-generational opportunity in essential minerals is here. That\u2019s why I\u2019m sending out a buy signal on a company called Callinex Mines (TSX-V: CNX, OTC: CLLXF)** that develops assets containing zinc, copper, lead, gold, and silver. Callinex has a large land position in Canada\u2019s Flin Flon mining district led by the company\u2019s 100%-owned Pine Bay, which hosts the high-grade copper, zinc, gold, and silver Rainbow deposit. In New Brunswick, Callinex Mines has reported near-surface mineral discoveries 6.8 kilometers apart in proximity to a PEA-stage, open-pittable zinc/lead/silver deposit with proximity to infrastructure. These mineral resources will be extremely valuable since copper, zinc, and other essential resources are challenging to get out of the ground unless you already have the permits, infrastructure, and experienced leadership in place like Callinex Mines does.\n4. The FED will raise rates three times next year, with the first being in March. Trump was right about this being a strong recovery; Powell is saying the U.S. economy is a beast right now.\n5. Apart from more variants, Powell thinks the job market is very healthy and will get stronger, with GDP growth projected to be 4% in 2022.\n\n**2022 will be one of the best years for Main Street America in the past 50 years, mark my words. There will be more jobs, better wages, massive retail discounts in stores, and a divorce from COVID. The best is really yet to come!** Full disclaimer at [GoldStandardIR.com/cnxdisclaimer](http://goldstandardir.com/cnxdisclaimer?fbclid=IwAR0tW2CVc-Or_uCIwZ3TmNpa8jfeqKlcgeF58JCW1g6lCDC9WxMlChiZwE4)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 0}]}

However, even seasoned investors can find some use out of this by getting back to the basics. This quick guide isn't meant to focus on financial metrics, but in an effort to explore companies based on the world around us.\n\nPreface: This is directed for individuals that are just starting to invest, in hopes of empowering them to continue to grow upon the knowledge they learn on in this post! This is also a post to help highlight a new social investing platform I've been building called [Mainstreet](https://mainstreetportfolio.com/) (currently in beta) that helps you invest with your friends, track your portfolios, and build communities with one another. Happy investing!\n\n**How To Find Stocks (for the Normal Investor)**\n\nOne of the most common questions I get when talking to someone just getting into investing, is something along the lines of \u201cWhich stocks are good?\u201d or \u201cHow do I find stocks to invest in?\u201d. Some of the reasons individuals choose not to invest is due to the \u201clack of knowledge\u201d or perhaps they are \u201cintimidated by the market\u201d. These are all valid reasons to not invest, but I feel like by providing the education and resources to learn about these topics in an easy and digestible manner will help people overcome these barriers and feel empowered to take control of their wealth, whether it\u2019s through real estate, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll dive into some of the strategies and methods I used to help gain knowledge and insight when investing in the stock market. Keep in mind this is not the definitive guide, but it\u2019s steps that I took to help me become more financially literate about the stock market. Everyone\u2019s path to financial education is different and unique and this is only meant to provide a different perspective for someone just starting out.\n\n**Pay Attention to the World Around You**\n\nThe first thing I usually tell people is, start to observe the world around you and the businesses that are close to your network. You\u2019ll easily be able to find many companies if you start to shift your mindset and look at how the world functions.\n\nFirst, look at what kind of products or services you consume. Do you need to get your fix of vanilla latte at Starbucks ($SBUX) in the morning? More of a fast food person? Let\u2019s look at McDonalds ($MCD), Chipotle ($CMG), Shake Shack ($SHAK), or Restaurant Brands International ($QSR). Are you a hardcore gamer? Well, I\u2019m sure one of your games or consoles comes from Sony ($SNE), Nintendo ($NTDOY), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), or Microsoft ($MSFT). Or maybe you\u2019ve been working from home? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had to buy some products from Amazon ($AMZN) or Wayfair ($W) to spruce up your office space. You\u2019re probably also using things like Zoom ($ZM), Google Drive ($GOOG or $GOOGL), or Slack to keep yourself productive during the day.\n\n**Build a Watchlist**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got the brain working a little, it\u2019s important to start building a watchlist of all the stocks you\u2019ve thought of. You can use your broker watchlist tool, or even an app like Yahoo Finance, WeBull, etc. Sort them in a way that works for you, whether it\u2019s by sector (financial, tech, industrials), subsector (gaming, oil, e-commerce), or even by priority (Watchlist Tier 1, Watchlist Tier 2, etc.)\n\nOrganization is key when building your watchlist. You\u2019ll want to have them organized because it\u2019ll help you get a quick glance of what\u2019s happening in the market at any given time. By checking on the stocks you\u2019ve added to your watchlist periodically, you\u2019ll learn how they move according to catalysts (market news, earnings, etc) and be able to plan how and when you\u2019d like to invest in them.\n\n**Search within an Index Fund or ETF**\n\nA great way to search up companies is by looking at current index fund or ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) allocations. With index funds, you can look at the holdings of the S&amp;P500 (Top 500 American companies) or the Nasdaq 100 (Most active, largest 100 Nasdaq companies). At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of the S&amp;P500 are:\n\n1. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)\n2. Microsoft Corp ($MSFT)\n3. Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN)\n4. Facebook, Inc. ($FB)\n5. Alphabet Inc. Class A ($GOOGL)\n6. Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG)\n7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc ($BRK.B)\n8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ($JPM)\n9. Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA)\n10. Johnson &amp; Johnson ($JNJ)\n\nAnother way is to look into the holdings of an ETF. There are tons of ETFs out there that track indices like $SPY and $QQQ, which track the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, as well as more focused sector ETFs, like the ARK Innovation Fund ($ARKK) or the O\u2019Shares Global Internet Giants Fund ($OGIG).\n\nOne of my favorites is ARKK, as they focus on disruptive innovation and change. So, for example, if something like this was to resonate with you, looking into their top holdings will give you some insight on what kinds of companies you\u2019d need to do research on to gain exposure to this particular strategy. At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of ARKK are:\n\n1. Tesla, Inc ($TSLA)\n2. Teladoc Health, Inc. ($TDOC)\n3. Roku, Inc. ($ROKU)\n4. Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)\n5. Square, Inc. ($SQ)\n6. Shopify, Inc ($SHOP)\n7. Spotify Technology SA ($SPOT)\n8. Twilio, Inc (TWLO)\n9. Coinbase Global, Inc ($COIN)\n10. Unity Software, Inc ($U)\n\nHopefully looking into index funds or ETFs like the ones listed above help spark curiosity and the urge to build on your own knowledge!\n\n**Invest in Things You Understand (Personal, Business)**\n\nAnother piece of advice I like to give people is to only invest in areas of the market you understand. For example, if I see a sector like biotech or cybersecurity shoot up 50% in the last three months, but I don\u2019t really understand how this industry works, don\u2019t put your money in it. Simple as that. If the whole stock market started to fall, these will be the easiest to target as a potential sell because you don\u2019t understand the industry or the company at all. Your conviction on the stock is low so incentive to hold onto it for the long term is also low.\n\nFor me, I\u2019m a big gamer and I understand the industry well. To compare it to the previous example above, I can take those companies and further extrapolate to build upon my research using my existing knowledge. As a result, I\u2019m aware that gaming consoles use chips from Intel ($INTC), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), as well as GPU processors from Nvidia ($NVDA). Many video games are developed on software applications like Unity ($U). I\u2019m also aware that a large population of gamers and gaming companies come from Asia and Europe, therefore I can look into stocks like Ubisoft ($UBI), Capcom ($CCOEF), or even Tencent Holdings ($TCEHY). What about gaming accessories from Corsair ($CRSR) or Logitech ($LOGI)? And let\u2019s not forget about Gamestop ($GME)!\n\nAnother great way to leverage your knowledge is to look at your workplace and how the business is structured from within. Does your company utilize products or services from other companies? If you work at a software company, perhaps you use Cisco ($CSCO) or Ciena ($CIEN) for your networking. If your company uses customer or sales support, you may be using something like Salesforce ($CRM), Twilio ($TWLO), or Zendesk ($ZEN). To optimize your business, your company may also be leveraging cybersecurity services like Palo Alto ($PALO), Okta ($OKTA), or Crowdstrike ($CRWD). By looking within your own workplace, you\u2019ll be able to do a bit of deeper digging to find stocks that services businesses and aren\u2019t as customer facing.\n\nUnderstanding an industry well allows you to build your conviction in that industry. By fully grasping the ins and outs, you\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re invested in. This prevents panicking or selling if you suddenly see a red day, because you know what the company is fundamentally and potentially capable of. It also allows you to get invested in the companies you\u2019re buying, ultimately feeling like a small owner of the company, which is exactly what the function of stocks are.\n\n**Diversify your Portfolio**\n\nSo now, you\u2019ve done a bit of research and found a ton of stocks you might potentially invest in. Now what? Well, now is where you want to think about risk management and portfolio diversity.\n\nFrom Investopedia, diversification is a \u201crisk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\u201d\n\nHow do I know what\u2019s diversified enough? Great question, but that\u2019s up to your personal risk tolerance. Try not to allocate all your stocks into one single sector or area of the market. By broadening out in sector (tech, industrial), subsector (5G, banks), geography (US, Asia, Europe), market cap (large, medium, small), and more, you can feel comfortable and confident with your investments. The last thing you want to be doing is checking your stocks every minute and wondering if you should buy more or sell it off. Also consider the timeline of your allocations. The majority of my portfolio is in long-term investments (3+ years), but I do have a small portion of my portfolio allocated to mid-term and momentum investments (less than two years), such as options and swing trading. It\u2019s up to each individual investor to determine these allocations and stay committed to knowing when to change your allocation based on your time horizon.\n\nConsider this portfolio of $10000 dollars: (Stock, dollar amount\\[%\\], sector/subsector/geography/market cap)\n\n* Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA - $1000 (10%) - Tech / EV / USA / Large\n* Alibaba Group ($BABA) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / E-Commerce / ASIA / Large\n* Bank of America ($BAC) - $1000 (10%) - Financials / Banking / USA / Large\n* GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Pharma / EU / Large\n* Brookfield Renewable ($BEP)- $1000 (10%) - Energy / Renewable / CAN / Large\n* Papa John\u2019s Int. ($PZZA)- $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Consumer/ USA / Mid\n* Ubisoft Entertainment ($UBI) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / Gaming / EU / Mid\n* Barrick Gold ($GOLD) - $1000 (10%) - Industrials / Mining / CAN / Mid\n* Aurora Cannabis ($ACB) - $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Cannabis / CAN / Small\n* Nano-X Imaging ($NNOX) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Telehealth / Israel / Small\n\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve been able to allocate into many different sectors, subsectors, geographies, and market caps. If one of these companies were to disappear tomorrow, we\u2019d still have 90% of our portfolio remaining.\n\nOf our mock portfolio, our sector allocation is the following: 30% Technology, 20% Consumer, 20% Health, and 10% each in Financials, Energy, and Industrials. Our subsector allocation is fully diversified in 10 subsectors of the market: Electric Vehicles, E-Commerce, Banking, Pharma, Renewable Energy, Consumer, Gaming, Mining, Cannabis, and Telehealth. In terms of geography, our allocation is the following: 30% USA, 30% Canada, 20% Europe, 10% Asia, and 10% Israel. With our market cap, our allocation is the following: 50% large, 30% mid, and 20% small. As you can see, this portfolio is well diversified in terms of sector, subsector, region, and market cap. These allocations will ultimately be up to you, as you will be in control of your portfolio.\n\n**Now You\u2019re Ready!**\n\nAnd that\u2019s it, we\u2019ve learned how to find stocks by looking at your surroundings using your own knowledge from your personal and work life and now you understand how to properly diversify a portfolio based on your own risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\n**Mainstreet**\n\nThis article is part of a series of articles aimed at assisting investors to take control of their wealth on Mainstreet.

Im about to present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to 75x your  money\\*\\*.\\*\\* Too much, or too good to be true? Im being conservative. Hear  me out.\n\n**First, I shall Flex:**\n\n1. I  am an MD and a Professor. To spell out the obvious, I have insight into  what matters in the medical world. Many pure researchers lack this  (cough cough Elisabeth Bik). In addition, As medical school faculty, If I  can't figure it out, I know who to ask.\n2. I started investing (profitably) before most of you were born.\n\nWhy  flex? To make it abundantly clear, my opinion on biotech investing  matters just a little. With that said, once more, listen up!\n\n**The Pickle:**\n\nYou  youngins haven't noticed, but Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of  death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. The kicker is,  there is NO effective treatment.\n\nThe  FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm. This drug has  significant adverse events. The risk of brain swelling requires serial  Brain MRIs. It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV  infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k. Most incredible is  that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate  trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make  later).\n\nAgain, for emphasis, the  FDA still approved it because the need is that severe. President Biden  recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation  over a trillion dollars.\n\n**The Fix: $SAVA**\n\nCassava  Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive  function in its CMS trial. The degree and duration of improvement have  NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic.  It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that  behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it  doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the  discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.\n\nYes,  we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc. A genuine  criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased  critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the  usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives  conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the  ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.\n\nWithout  getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere  criticisms is Phase 3 trials. There is no valid argument against this  statement. This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use  absolute phrases. If you take away only one point from this article,  then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start  early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more  about him later). Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after  the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also  threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy. Be angry,  fellow apes, be angry. Im just getting started, BTW.\n\nDo  market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal?  They do. That is why the stock price went from &lt; $1 to an ATH of  $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my  family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the  first place.\n\n**The Villan and His Massacre:**\n\nJordan  Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a \"Citizens Petition.\"  A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit)  out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical  to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed  another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.\n\nEssentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second,  sold their shares. SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the  making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog ([https://ad-science.org/](https://ad-science.org/)),  Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it  biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.\n\n1. Jordan  Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that  patients are literally dying as they wait. WTF!? Why, why why?? If you  aren't angry, somethings wrong with you. JT states he is concerned for  patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there  is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected,  JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly.  In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did  JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that  is the \\*only\\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is  safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall  continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these  petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is  horrendous (3% success rate)? Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who  uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD  in its purest form.\n2. Then  why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous  document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe  even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my  position by 30%. With that said, Im not surprised the masses started  selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent,  it's an \\*opportunity\\*\u2014a second chance to buy the stock on clearance.\n\n**The Financials:**\n\n$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue.\n\nFifty  million patients are suffering from AD globally. 6 million of those  patients reside in the US. Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American  market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs  $20k annually, just a bit over a third the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's  soon to fail drug):\n\n1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000\n\nThat  calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up  as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment  options). The current stock price is $50. The overly conservative  valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750\n\nThe above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia.\n\n**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**\n\nIf  you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading  causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a  hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of  death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment.  Thats devastating for patients, but families? It's not uncommon for  families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they \"can't  handle it anymore.\" This market is massive and unaddressed! Severely,  painfully, and gravely unaddressed.\n\nI  have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires  (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process. JT is only the  face of this farce. Behind him are many short positions making a 100  million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their  short-term gain. There is something far more concerning.\n\n**The Plot Thickens:**\n\nWhat  I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or  short-term price action. There is something much more sinister. Biogen  has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved. Now it  is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a  problem:\n\nFDA advisory committee  voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then  saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently,  a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and  Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to  support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and  Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the  country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's  AD drug. This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you  to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no  other therapy on the market. Well, what happens if a new, more effective  medication shows up?\n\n**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**\n\nBack  to our Villian JT. JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the  initial \"Citizens Patetion\") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works. Why? I  speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous  whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried  about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in  profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is  more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer. There is  little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less. When that  happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug. Biogen already  has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to  rejuvenate the companies earnings. Then expediently and as expected,  Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.\n\nI  believe that is the root issue. Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become  furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam! A group of us have  gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to  investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).\n\n**Short term price action:**\n\n1. Im  expecting the SP to bounce. After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a  perfect overreaction play. If you dont know what Im talking about, you  can look up \"overreaction with reversion to the mean.\"\n2. Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within \"weeks to months.\"\n3. Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks. (\"Soon\" per Remi)\n4. Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.\n\n\\#SAVA's  float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted  with utilization of &gt;90%. It'll take very little to make SAVA move,  big. Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.\n\nI  have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on  SAVA. My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!). I'll  finish with one last piece of advice. Over 19 years of investing, my  most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading  and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment  by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further  propagated by \"experts\" tweeting and commenting with their hidden  agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual  published results, but apparently, her opinion counts? Comments of her  blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical  vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, \"oh, he sounds  smart, so he must be right.\" or \"That sounds complicated, he must be on  to something.\" In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical  details are fooling many. DFV saw something well before masses, and he  was paid handsomely for it.\n\nIf my  opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen,  then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in  with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs.  a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.\n\nI am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD before making any decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": -1}]}

As the leader in Canada with 100+ dispensaries now running with the Costco discount model, I have high confidence that this model will be what turns the company profitable in the near future, alongside their accretive e-commerce acquisitions. I say this because of their vertical integrated accessories business. This is something that does not get talked about enough for $HITI. Manufacturing the bulk of the accessories they sale in-house, it enables them to make up margins when discounting flower to undercut the legal market and take market share from the illicit market. The #1 thing I will be looking for here is how $HITI manages their operational expenses as they continue to open up more stores - WILL BE CRUCIAL!!\n\nAs noted previously, $HITI continues to purchase accretive e-commerce assets. Not only do they own the top 3 e-commerce websites for cannabis accessories, but also own subscription company Daily High Club and numerous juggernaut CBD e-commerce companies (FabCBD and NuLeaf in US and Blessed CBD in UK). I am sure they have something in Germany in the works knowing Raj or they will go in there with Blessed CBD. All these companies will add more revenue to $HITI and will easily integrate into their current ecosystem - not adding too many expenses. As management continues to buy up profitable assets that easily integrate into $HITI current infrastructure, economies of scales will be achieved - this will take time... PAYTIENCE. $HITI is setting up their e-commerce systems and processes within the cannabis accessories market and CBD markets globally, so that once flower is legalized in the US and other countries, the systems and processes are already in place to plug in a new product (flower). I believe we will see some positive earnings reports throughout 2022 especially in the second half - REMEMBER THIS IS A LONG TERM PLAY! 2023 will be an even better year than 2022.\n\nIn addition, all of the proprietary data that $HITI is accumulating with all of these e-commerce assets and the ones they will buy in the future will be something they will leverage as they expand into other geographic areas. They will know what products to start with and what customer profiles to go after to achieve the highest margins. In addition, they already have 250,000+ Canna Cabana members, and this will only continue to grow as consumers in Canada realize how great the deals are compared to competitors - not only on flower but accessories, which we all know are needed to consume cannabis. Another thing I am bullish on with $HITI and all of its online assets is that once online advertising is legalized for cannabis companies (Google ads) it will only help them make more revenue with higher margins as we all know that online marketing - when done right - can help grow companies even more. And don't get me started on how much more revenue $HITI will make once they begin deliveries of cannabis in March!!!\n\nLastly, when you compare $HITI past 1 year return vs all the MSOS and Canadian LPs, not many companies have weathered the 2021 storm as well as $HITI has. Go to Google Finance or wherever and go to the 1 year chart and compare $HITI returns to other cannabis companies. Most are negative where $HITI has seen a 47.44% gain despite the 2021 accumulation phase. We are near the bottom, we may even see $4 before the next run up but I will just continue accumulating.\n\nWe are in a prime time within this accumulation phase. Don't let it go to waste."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 0}]}

An investment\u2019s ESG score measures the sustainability of an investment in three specific categories: environmental, social and corporate governance.\n\nInvestors interested in environmental, social and governance issues often cite climate concerns as guiding their ESG investments.\n\nThey were rewarded during the market crash as oil prices cratered. In the first quarter, sustainability-focused funds held up better than the broader fund market during the initial bear market sell-off \u2013 driven in part by less exposure to fossil fuel energy.\n\nThat said, ESG goes beyond not buying petroleum companies; there's the \"S\" and the \"G\" parts, too, and those may take greater prominence as people focus on health care amid the pandemic and the social unrest triggered by systemic racism.\n\nThe global sustainable fund universe attracted $45.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020, versus an outflow of $384.7 billion from the overall fund universe. In the U.S. specifically, the research firm found that in the first quarter, flows into open-end and sustainable ETFs reached $10.5 billion, eclipsing the previous record set in 2019's fourth quarter.\n\nA June survey in 2020 from global investment manager Nuveen showed high-net-worth investors are starting to choose ESG for its outperformance, in addition to having a positive social impact, with 53% of respondents citing returns as their top reason to invest in ESG.\n\nAs such, it seems to be a wise choice to get started on an ESG portfolio. Here are some picks to get you started.\n\n***Coca-Cola (KO)***\n\nAs a mega-cap stock with a current market value around $250 billion, Coca-Cola has already partially recovered from the loss in sales due to the pandemic. Analysts suggest that by providing a dividend yield of approximately 3.1%, Coca-Cola makes the list of the top recovery stocks of 2021.\n\nMoreover, if you\u2019re looking for companies that strictly adhere to ESG policies, Coca-Cola has an AA rating from MSCI. The company performs exceptionally well when it comes to waste management, ensuring health and safety standards, and controlling the carbon footprint per product.\n\nThese attributes make it one of the leading ESG dividend stock companies in the beverage industry. Interestingly, only 15% have an AA rating from MSCI, while only 9% have a higher AAA rating.\n\n***Honeywell (HON)***\n\nHoneywell is an ESG-compliant company that shows high growth potential due to its share-price appreciation.\n\nThe Street predicts around 11% annual average growth for the company in the next few years, with a strong \u2018Buy\u2019 rating. Honeywell has consistently raised its dividends since 2014, going up from 45 cents per share to 95 cents last year.\n\nAs far as ESG compliance is concerned, Honeywell holds an AA rating from MSCI. Offering a dividend yield of 1.6%, Honeywell maintains its ESG rating among 14% of its industry peers, having the AA rating.\n\n***NVIDIA (NVDA)***\n\nThis is a well-known company producing graphics and video processing cards, remained unaffected by the pandemic. Analysts suggest that the company is bound to face the most prominent growth rate in the tech sector, surpassing artificial intelligence and auto technology. On the ESG end, NVIDIA is highly rated because of its mineral policy and effective corporate governance. The company uses rare minerals to build its chips and cards; therefore, it has a stringent policy against unethical procurement and mining of these minerals.\n\n***Chr. Hansen (CHYHY)***\n\nThe Danish human nutrition giant Chr. Hansen ranks high in ESG compliance due to its sustainable practices regarding food security and waste management. The company mainly produces bacteria that help curb the extended use of harmful pesticides while increasing crop yield at the same time.\n\nMoreover, Chr. Hansen has successfully developed an accounting system according to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. This helps the company assess the impact of each product and display the metrics to investors.\n\nThese extra measures place Chr. Hansen in the first place on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations List.\n\n***MBH Corporation (MBHCF)***\n\nMBH is a holding company actively building a portfolio of profitable, earnings accretive, debt-free small to medium enterprises (SME) that are expected to have a higher-than-normal growth profile as part of a larger organization. The company's operating model leaves management of the acquired companies to operate autonomously and fully accountable to develop and grow their businesses. As part of a larger organization, the acquired companies and in turn, MBH get the benefits of both worlds. This small holding company may have just started out, but it is pumping out revenue steadily and healthily and pays a 2% dividend. MBH Corporation has won five stars for their ESG credentials, getting into the top 1% of the nearly 2,000 businesses in the Support the Goals database. They have achieved this level of commitment through their work with inequality and climate goals. Support the Goals encourages businesses to take responsibility and the organisation expects companies 'to demonstrate how you support the world\u2019s most important action plan'.\n\n***NextEra Energy (NEE)***\n\nNextEra is the largest electric utility by market cap. Over the last few decades, the company has been consistently reducing its emissions through increased renewable energy use. Its CO2 emissions are 55% less than those of an average US utility. NextEra has now set an ambitious goal of reducing CO2 emissions, by 2025, by 67% from its 2005 base levels. This goal effectively means that absolute CO2 emissions would go down by 40% even while NextEra\u2019s energy production would double during that time. To its credit, the company last year received a best-in-class preparedness assessment by S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 ESG Evaluation. NextEra has, essentially, received the highest ranking given by S&amp;P to a company within the utility sector.\n\n***Microsoft (MSFT)***\n\nMicrosoft has taken the lead in its commitment towards carbon mitigation by becoming the first company among its peers to target \u201ccarbon negative\u201d status by 2030. It has created a $1 billion fund to reduce emissions and start clearing carbon. This ambitious commitment is unprecedented and sets Microsoft apart from its entire sector. Microsoft received the highest ESG rating of AAA from MSCI ESG Research in September 2019.\n\n***Prologis (PLD)***\n\nPrologis is a logistics-focused REIT with multiple \u201cfirst company to\u2026\u201d accomplishments in the ESG space. Prologis is the first real estate company to issue green bonds. It is also the first real estate company to be awarded the WELL certification by the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI). Additionally, Prologis is the first logistics company to receive approved SBTs or \u201cScience-Based Targets\u201d necessary to meet the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement of 2015. The company ranks highly on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World list and on the Investor\u2019s Business Daily (IBD) 50 Best ESG Companies list."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 1}]}

An investment\u2019s ESG score measures the sustainability of an investment in three specific categories: environmental, social and corporate governance.\n\nInvestors interested in environmental, social and governance issues often cite climate concerns as guiding their ESG investments.\n\nThey were rewarded during the market crash as oil prices cratered. In the first quarter, sustainability-focused funds held up better than the broader fund market during the initial bear market sell-off \u2013 driven in part by less exposure to fossil fuel energy.\n\nThat said, ESG goes beyond not buying petroleum companies; there's the \"S\" and the \"G\" parts, too, and those may take greater prominence as people focus on health care amid the pandemic and the social unrest triggered by systemic racism.\n\nThe global sustainable fund universe attracted $45.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020, versus an outflow of $384.7 billion from the overall fund universe. In the U.S. specifically, the research firm found that in the first quarter, flows into open-end and sustainable ETFs reached $10.5 billion, eclipsing the previous record set in 2019's fourth quarter.\n\nA June survey in 2020 from global investment manager Nuveen showed high-net-worth investors are starting to choose ESG for its outperformance, in addition to having a positive social impact, with 53% of respondents citing returns as their top reason to invest in ESG.\n\nAs such, it seems to be a wise choice to get started on an ESG portfolio. Here are some picks to get you started.\n\n***Coca-Cola (KO)***\n\nAs a mega-cap stock with a current market value around $250 billion, Coca-Cola has already partially recovered from the loss in sales due to the pandemic. Analysts suggest that by providing a dividend yield of approximately 3.1%, Coca-Cola makes the list of the top recovery stocks of 2021.\n\nMoreover, if you\u2019re looking for companies that strictly adhere to ESG policies, Coca-Cola has an AA rating from MSCI. The company performs exceptionally well when it comes to waste management, ensuring health and safety standards, and controlling the carbon footprint per product.\n\nThese attributes make it one of the leading ESG dividend stock companies in the beverage industry. Interestingly, only 15% have an AA rating from MSCI, while only 9% have a higher AAA rating.\n\n***Honeywell (HON)***\n\nHoneywell is an ESG-compliant company that shows high growth potential due to its share-price appreciation.\n\nThe Street predicts around 11% annual average growth for the company in the next few years, with a strong \u2018Buy\u2019 rating. Honeywell has consistently raised its dividends since 2014, going up from 45 cents per share to 95 cents last year.\n\nAs far as ESG compliance is concerned, Honeywell holds an AA rating from MSCI. Offering a dividend yield of 1.6%, Honeywell maintains its ESG rating among 14% of its industry peers, having the AA rating.\n\n***NVIDIA (NVDA)***\n\nThis is a well-known company producing graphics and video processing cards, remained unaffected by the pandemic. Analysts suggest that the company is bound to face the most prominent growth rate in the tech sector, surpassing artificial intelligence and auto technology. On the ESG end, NVIDIA is highly rated because of its mineral policy and effective corporate governance. The company uses rare minerals to build its chips and cards; therefore, it has a stringent policy against unethical procurement and mining of these minerals.\n\n***Chr. Hansen (CHYHY)***\n\nThe Danish human nutrition giant Chr. Hansen ranks high in ESG compliance due to its sustainable practices regarding food security and waste management. The company mainly produces bacteria that help curb the extended use of harmful pesticides while increasing crop yield at the same time.\n\nMoreover, Chr. Hansen has successfully developed an accounting system according to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. This helps the company assess the impact of each product and display the metrics to investors.\n\nThese extra measures place Chr. Hansen in the first place on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations List.\n\n***MBH Corporation (MBHCF)***\n\nMBH is a holding company actively building a portfolio of profitable, earnings accretive, debt-free small to medium enterprises (SME) that are expected to have a higher-than-normal growth profile as part of a larger organization. The company's operating model leaves management of the acquired companies to operate autonomously and fully accountable to develop and grow their businesses. As part of a larger organization, the acquired companies and in turn, MBH get the benefits of both worlds. This small holding company may have just started out, but it is pumping out revenue steadily and healthily and pays a 2% dividend. MBH Corporation has won five stars for their ESG credentials, getting into the top 1% of the nearly 2,000 businesses in the Support the Goals database. They have achieved this level of commitment through their work with inequality and climate goals. Support the Goals encourages businesses to take responsibility and the organisation expects companies 'to demonstrate how you support the world\u2019s most important action plan'.\n\n***NextEra Energy (NEE)***\n\nNextEra is the largest electric utility by market cap. Over the last few decades, the company has been consistently reducing its emissions through increased renewable energy use. Its CO2 emissions are 55% less than those of an average US utility. NextEra has now set an ambitious goal of reducing CO2 emissions, by 2025, by 67% from its 2005 base levels. This goal effectively means that absolute CO2 emissions would go down by 40% even while NextEra\u2019s energy production would double during that time. To its credit, the company last year received a best-in-class preparedness assessment by S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 ESG Evaluation. NextEra has, essentially, received the highest ranking given by S&amp;P to a company within the utility sector.\n\n***Microsoft (MSFT)***\n\nMicrosoft has taken the lead in its commitment towards carbon mitigation by becoming the first company among its peers to target \u201ccarbon negative\u201d status by 2030. It has created a $1 billion fund to reduce emissions and start clearing carbon. This ambitious commitment is unprecedented and sets Microsoft apart from its entire sector. Microsoft received the highest ESG rating of AAA from MSCI ESG Research in September 2019.\n\n***Prologis (PLD)***\n\nPrologis is a logistics-focused REIT with multiple \u201cfirst company to\u2026\u201d accomplishments in the ESG space. Prologis is the first real estate company to issue green bonds. It is also the first real estate company to be awarded the WELL certification by the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI). Additionally, Prologis is the first logistics company to receive approved SBTs or \u201cScience-Based Targets\u201d necessary to meet the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement of 2015. The company ranks highly on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World list and on the Investor\u2019s Business Daily (IBD) 50 Best ESG Companies list."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 1}]}

However, even seasoned investors can find some use out of this by getting back to the basics. This quick guide isn't meant to focus on financial metrics, but in an effort to explore companies based on the world around us.\n\nPreface: This is directed for individuals that are just starting to invest, in hopes of empowering them to continue to grow upon the knowledge they learn on in this post! This is also a post to help highlight a new social investing platform I've been building called [Mainstreet](https://mainstreetportfolio.com/) (currently in beta) that helps you invest with your friends, track your portfolios, and build communities with one another. Happy investing!\n\n**How To Find Stocks (for the Normal Investor)**\n\nOne of the most common questions I get when talking to someone just getting into investing, is something along the lines of \u201cWhich stocks are good?\u201d or \u201cHow do I find stocks to invest in?\u201d. Some of the reasons individuals choose not to invest is due to the \u201clack of knowledge\u201d or perhaps they are \u201cintimidated by the market\u201d. These are all valid reasons to not invest, but I feel like by providing the education and resources to learn about these topics in an easy and digestible manner will help people overcome these barriers and feel empowered to take control of their wealth, whether it\u2019s through real estate, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll dive into some of the strategies and methods I used to help gain knowledge and insight when investing in the stock market. Keep in mind this is not the definitive guide, but it\u2019s steps that I took to help me become more financially literate about the stock market. Everyone\u2019s path to financial education is different and unique and this is only meant to provide a different perspective for someone just starting out.\n\n**Pay Attention to the World Around You**\n\nThe first thing I usually tell people is, start to observe the world around you and the businesses that are close to your network. You\u2019ll easily be able to find many companies if you start to shift your mindset and look at how the world functions.\n\nFirst, look at what kind of products or services you consume. Do you need to get your fix of vanilla latte at Starbucks ($SBUX) in the morning? More of a fast food person? Let\u2019s look at McDonalds ($MCD), Chipotle ($CMG), Shake Shack ($SHAK), or Restaurant Brands International ($QSR). Are you a hardcore gamer? Well, I\u2019m sure one of your games or consoles comes from Sony ($SNE), Nintendo ($NTDOY), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), or Microsoft ($MSFT). Or maybe you\u2019ve been working from home? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had to buy some products from Amazon ($AMZN) or Wayfair ($W) to spruce up your office space. You\u2019re probably also using things like Zoom ($ZM), Google Drive ($GOOG or $GOOGL), or Slack to keep yourself productive during the day.\n\n**Build a Watchlist**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got the brain working a little, it\u2019s important to start building a watchlist of all the stocks you\u2019ve thought of. You can use your broker watchlist tool, or even an app like Yahoo Finance, WeBull, etc. Sort them in a way that works for you, whether it\u2019s by sector (financial, tech, industrials), subsector (gaming, oil, e-commerce), or even by priority (Watchlist Tier 1, Watchlist Tier 2, etc.)\n\nOrganization is key when building your watchlist. You\u2019ll want to have them organized because it\u2019ll help you get a quick glance of what\u2019s happening in the market at any given time. By checking on the stocks you\u2019ve added to your watchlist periodically, you\u2019ll learn how they move according to catalysts (market news, earnings, etc) and be able to plan how and when you\u2019d like to invest in them.\n\n**Search within an Index Fund or ETF**\n\nA great way to search up companies is by looking at current index fund or ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) allocations. With index funds, you can look at the holdings of the S&amp;P500 (Top 500 American companies) or the Nasdaq 100 (Most active, largest 100 Nasdaq companies). At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of the S&amp;P500 are:\n\n1. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)\n2. Microsoft Corp ($MSFT)\n3. Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN)\n4. Facebook, Inc. ($FB)\n5. Alphabet Inc. Class A ($GOOGL)\n6. Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG)\n7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc ($BRK.B)\n8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ($JPM)\n9. Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA)\n10. Johnson &amp; Johnson ($JNJ)\n\nAnother way is to look into the holdings of an ETF. There are tons of ETFs out there that track indices like $SPY and $QQQ, which track the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, as well as more focused sector ETFs, like the ARK Innovation Fund ($ARKK) or the O\u2019Shares Global Internet Giants Fund ($OGIG).\n\nOne of my favorites is ARKK, as they focus on disruptive innovation and change. So, for example, if something like this was to resonate with you, looking into their top holdings will give you some insight on what kinds of companies you\u2019d need to do research on to gain exposure to this particular strategy. At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of ARKK are:\n\n1. Tesla, Inc ($TSLA)\n2. Teladoc Health, Inc. ($TDOC)\n3. Roku, Inc. ($ROKU)\n4. Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)\n5. Square, Inc. ($SQ)\n6. Shopify, Inc ($SHOP)\n7. Spotify Technology SA ($SPOT)\n8. Twilio, Inc (TWLO)\n9. Coinbase Global, Inc ($COIN)\n10. Unity Software, Inc ($U)\n\nHopefully looking into index funds or ETFs like the ones listed above help spark curiosity and the urge to build on your own knowledge!\n\n**Invest in Things You Understand (Personal, Business)**\n\nAnother piece of advice I like to give people is to only invest in areas of the market you understand. For example, if I see a sector like biotech or cybersecurity shoot up 50% in the last three months, but I don\u2019t really understand how this industry works, don\u2019t put your money in it. Simple as that. If the whole stock market started to fall, these will be the easiest to target as a potential sell because you don\u2019t understand the industry or the company at all. Your conviction on the stock is low so incentive to hold onto it for the long term is also low.\n\nFor me, I\u2019m a big gamer and I understand the industry well. To compare it to the previous example above, I can take those companies and further extrapolate to build upon my research using my existing knowledge. As a result, I\u2019m aware that gaming consoles use chips from Intel ($INTC), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), as well as GPU processors from Nvidia ($NVDA). Many video games are developed on software applications like Unity ($U). I\u2019m also aware that a large population of gamers and gaming companies come from Asia and Europe, therefore I can look into stocks like Ubisoft ($UBI), Capcom ($CCOEF), or even Tencent Holdings ($TCEHY). What about gaming accessories from Corsair ($CRSR) or Logitech ($LOGI)? And let\u2019s not forget about Gamestop ($GME)!\n\nAnother great way to leverage your knowledge is to look at your workplace and how the business is structured from within. Does your company utilize products or services from other companies? If you work at a software company, perhaps you use Cisco ($CSCO) or Ciena ($CIEN) for your networking. If your company uses customer or sales support, you may be using something like Salesforce ($CRM), Twilio ($TWLO), or Zendesk ($ZEN). To optimize your business, your company may also be leveraging cybersecurity services like Palo Alto ($PALO), Okta ($OKTA), or Crowdstrike ($CRWD). By looking within your own workplace, you\u2019ll be able to do a bit of deeper digging to find stocks that services businesses and aren\u2019t as customer facing.\n\nUnderstanding an industry well allows you to build your conviction in that industry. By fully grasping the ins and outs, you\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re invested in. This prevents panicking or selling if you suddenly see a red day, because you know what the company is fundamentally and potentially capable of. It also allows you to get invested in the companies you\u2019re buying, ultimately feeling like a small owner of the company, which is exactly what the function of stocks are.\n\n**Diversify your Portfolio**\n\nSo now, you\u2019ve done a bit of research and found a ton of stocks you might potentially invest in. Now what? Well, now is where you want to think about risk management and portfolio diversity.\n\nFrom Investopedia, diversification is a \u201crisk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\u201d\n\nHow do I know what\u2019s diversified enough? Great question, but that\u2019s up to your personal risk tolerance. Try not to allocate all your stocks into one single sector or area of the market. By broadening out in sector (tech, industrial), subsector (5G, banks), geography (US, Asia, Europe), market cap (large, medium, small), and more, you can feel comfortable and confident with your investments. The last thing you want to be doing is checking your stocks every minute and wondering if you should buy more or sell it off. Also consider the timeline of your allocations. The majority of my portfolio is in long-term investments (3+ years), but I do have a small portion of my portfolio allocated to mid-term and momentum investments (less than two years), such as options and swing trading. It\u2019s up to each individual investor to determine these allocations and stay committed to knowing when to change your allocation based on your time horizon.\n\nConsider this portfolio of $10000 dollars: (Stock, dollar amount\\[%\\], sector/subsector/geography/market cap)\n\n* Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA - $1000 (10%) - Tech / EV / USA / Large\n* Alibaba Group ($BABA) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / E-Commerce / ASIA / Large\n* Bank of America ($BAC) - $1000 (10%) - Financials / Banking / USA / Large\n* GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Pharma / EU / Large\n* Brookfield Renewable ($BEP)- $1000 (10%) - Energy / Renewable / CAN / Large\n* Papa John\u2019s Int. ($PZZA)- $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Consumer/ USA / Mid\n* Ubisoft Entertainment ($UBI) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / Gaming / EU / Mid\n* Barrick Gold ($GOLD) - $1000 (10%) - Industrials / Mining / CAN / Mid\n* Aurora Cannabis ($ACB) - $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Cannabis / CAN / Small\n* Nano-X Imaging ($NNOX) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Telehealth / Israel / Small\n\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve been able to allocate into many different sectors, subsectors, geographies, and market caps. If one of these companies were to disappear tomorrow, we\u2019d still have 90% of our portfolio remaining.\n\nOf our mock portfolio, our sector allocation is the following: 30% Technology, 20% Consumer, 20% Health, and 10% each in Financials, Energy, and Industrials. Our subsector allocation is fully diversified in 10 subsectors of the market: Electric Vehicles, E-Commerce, Banking, Pharma, Renewable Energy, Consumer, Gaming, Mining, Cannabis, and Telehealth. In terms of geography, our allocation is the following: 30% USA, 30% Canada, 20% Europe, 10% Asia, and 10% Israel. With our market cap, our allocation is the following: 50% large, 30% mid, and 20% small. As you can see, this portfolio is well diversified in terms of sector, subsector, region, and market cap. These allocations will ultimately be up to you, as you will be in control of your portfolio.\n\n**Now You\u2019re Ready!**\n\nAnd that\u2019s it, we\u2019ve learned how to find stocks by looking at your surroundings using your own knowledge from your personal and work life and now you understand how to properly diversify a portfolio based on your own risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\n**Mainstreet**\n\nThis article is part of a series of articles aimed at assisting investors to take control of their wealth on Mainstreet.

The dashboard is a work in progress but so far it has been useful for me to track trending stocks and be able to see new tickers on the leaderboard - before they become too popular.\n\nDashboard and Trending Stocks\n\nBefore we jump in, I wanted to provide a bit of background. This is a work in progress so I want to be transparent with how we are tracking these trends. If you have any thoughts on how I can make this more useful please let me know.\n\n**Tracking Mechanics**\n\n* The algorithm pulls data from multiple subreddits using the reddit API. The subreddits it is pulling from are non-stock specific subreddits (i.e. WBS, investing, stockmarket, pennystocks, etc.)\n* It then plots mentions with price over a give timeframe (Right now you can look at 72hrs, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 1 month)\n* We also display sentiment, number of posts, comments, and upvotes. Sentiment is determined using Spacy and a text classification dictionary\n\n**Why did we build this?**\n\n* We wanted a way to track social sentiment across a number of social media platforms. Studies show that sentiment can impact the price of a stock and we wanted to see if there is a way to leverage this and provide it to individual investors. The more you know, the better.\n* Allows you to see the overall trends, and the quickly drill into the posts to validate the content.\n\n**Future plans**\n\n* **Twitter (Beta)** \\- currently testing a way to capture twitter sentiment. I think there is opportunity to follow and track what a number of the largest Fintwit accounts discus and corelate to the price movement of smaller cap stocks. This is my hypothesis but I need to test it.\n* **Social Trend Score -** ultimately we want to be able to identify trending ticker before the price takes off, or before it drops - we are planning on incorporating data from multiple social platform\n\nTop 10 Trending Stocks on Reddit\n\nThe screenshot is pulled from the Social Sentiment Dashboard and shows the top trending tickers in the last 72hrs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a3ueu4pi3gr71.png?width=1013&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfb9d52ff30f38db5cbbe90ee0c22d8b0cc4f67e\n\n**CEI -** **Camber Energy, Inc.**, an independent oil and natural gas company, engages in the acquisition, development, and sale of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids (NGL) in the Cline shale and upper Wolfberry shale in Glasscock County, Texas. **2 weeks ago this was sitting at number 18 on the leaderboard**. It was getting a lot of traction on twitter and started to get more mentions on Reddit. It is now sitting at #4 on on top trending tickers. Over this time period the price increased close to 200%. I will need to look at this further but if I look back at the data it might be a good my to test the hypothesis.\n\n**SDC - SmileDirectClub, Inc**. operates as an oral care company. It offers clear aligner therapy treatment. This has been in the top 5 over the last 2 weeks. There have been a significant number of posts and mentions on WSB for SDC - a lot of DD floating around. A month ago it was sitting at #17, and then 2 weeks ago was #1 and was at $6.90 per share. Since that peak 2 weeks ago the pricedeclined \\~25% but the mentions and social sentiment has remained strong.\n\n**Other Thoughts**\n\nThe other tickers you see are ones that are usually on the leaderboard (AMC, GME, TSLA, QQQ, etc.) which is why it is useful to see what tickers are up and coming on the trend list. This leads me to another thought, it might be useful to be able to filter out certain tickers.\n\n**TLDR**; Track trending tickers on Reddit and potentially catch a ticker before the price hits a peak. The view also provides a way to quickly drill into potentially new tickers or stocks, and find the associated DD.\n\n*If you're interested, you can check out the* [Social Sentiment Dashboard here](https://utradea.com/social-dashboard)*.

The degree and duration of improvement have  NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic.  It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that  behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it  doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the  discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.\n\nYes,  we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc. A genuine  criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased  critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the  usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives  conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the  ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.\n\nWithout  getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere  criticisms is Phase 3 trials. There is no valid argument against this  statement. This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use  absolute phrases. If you take away only one point from this article,  then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start  early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more  about him later). Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after  the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also  threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy. Be angry,  fellow apes, be angry. Im just getting started, BTW.\n\nDo  market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal?  They do. That is why the stock price went from &lt; $1 to an ATH of  $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my  family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the  first place.\n\n**The Villan and His Massacre:**\n\nJordan  Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a \"Citizens Petition.\"  A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit)  out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical  to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed  another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.\n\nEssentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second,  sold their shares. SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the  making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog ([https://ad-science.org/](https://ad-science.org/)),  Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it  biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.\n\n1. Jordan  Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that  patients are literally dying as they wait. WTF!? Why, why why?? If you  aren't angry, somethings wrong with you. JT states he is concerned for  patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there  is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected,  JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly.  In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did  JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that  is the \\*only\\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is  safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall  continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these  petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is  horrendous (3% success rate)? Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who  uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD  in its purest form.\n2. Then  why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous  document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe  even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my  position by 30%. With that said, Im not surprised the masses started  selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent,  it's an \\*opportunity\\*\u2014a second chance to buy the stock on clearance.\n\n**The Financials:**\n\n$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue.\n\nFifty  million patients are suffering from AD globally. 6 million of those  patients reside in the US. Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American  market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs  $20k annually, just a bit over a third the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's  soon to fail drug):\n\n1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000\n\nThat  calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up  as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment  options). The current stock price is $50. The overly conservative  valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750\n\nThe above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia.\n\n**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**\n\nIf  you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading  causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a  hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of  death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment.  Thats devastating for patients, but families? It's not uncommon for  families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they \"can't  handle it anymore.\" This market is massive and unaddressed! Severely,  painfully, and gravely unaddressed.\n\nI  have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires  (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process. JT is only the  face of this farce. Behind him are many short positions making a 100  million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their  short-term gain. There is something far more concerning.\n\n**The Plot Thickens:**\n\nWhat  I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or  short-term price action. There is something much more sinister. Biogen  has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved. Now it  is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a  problem:\n\nFDA advisory committee  voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then  saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently,  a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and  Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to  support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and  Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the  country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's  AD drug. This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you  to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no  other therapy on the market. Well, what happens if a new, more effective  medication shows up?\n\n**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**\n\nBack  to our Villian JT. JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the  initial \"Citizens Patetion\") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works. Why? I  speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous  whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried  about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in  profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is  more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer. There is  little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less. When that  happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug. Biogen already  has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to  rejuvenate the companies earnings. Then expediently and as expected,  Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.\n\nI  believe that is the root issue. Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become  furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam! A group of us have  gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to  investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).\n\n**Short term price action:**\n\n1. Im  expecting the SP to bounce. After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a  perfect overreaction play. If you dont know what Im talking about, you  can look up \"overreaction with reversion to the mean.\"\n2. Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within \"weeks to months.\"\n3. Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks. (\"Soon\" per Remi)\n4. Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.\n\n\\#SAVA's  float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted  with utilization of &gt;90%. It'll take very little to make SAVA move,  big. Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.\n\nI  have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on  SAVA. My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!). I'll  finish with one last piece of advice. Over 19 years of investing, my  most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading  and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment  by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further  propagated by \"experts\" tweeting and commenting with their hidden  agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual  published results, but apparently, her opinion counts? Comments of her  blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical  vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, \"oh, he sounds  smart, so he must be right.\" or \"That sounds complicated, he must be on  to something.\" In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical  details are fooling many. DFV saw something well before masses, and he  was paid handsomely for it.\n\nIf my  opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen,  then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in  with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs.  a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.\n\nI am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD before making any decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": -1}]}

As emotions have settled, this blog ([https://ad-science.org/](https://ad-science.org/)),  Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it  biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.\n\n1. Jordan  Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that  patients are literally dying as they wait. WTF!? Why, why why?? If you  aren't angry, somethings wrong with you. JT states he is concerned for  patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there  is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected,  JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly.  In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did  JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that  is the \\*only\\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is  safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall  continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these  petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is  horrendous (3% success rate)? Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who  uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD  in its purest form.\n2. Then  why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous  document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe  even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my  position by 30%. With that said, Im not surprised the masses started  selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent,  it's an \\*opportunity\\*\u2014a second chance to buy the stock on clearance.\n\n**The Financials:**\n\n$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue.\n\nFifty  million patients are suffering from AD globally. 6 million of those  patients reside in the US. Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American  market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs  $20k annually, just a bit over a third the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's  soon to fail drug):\n\n1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000\n\nThat  calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up  as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment  options). The current stock price is $50. The overly conservative  valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750\n\nThe above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia.\n\n**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**\n\nIf  you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading  causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a  hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of  death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment.  Thats devastating for patients, but families? It's not uncommon for  families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they \"can't  handle it anymore.\" This market is massive and unaddressed! Severely,  painfully, and gravely unaddressed.\n\nI  have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires  (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process. JT is only the  face of this farce. Behind him are many short positions making a 100  million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their  short-term gain. There is something far more concerning.\n\n**The Plot Thickens:**\n\nWhat  I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or  short-term price action. There is something much more sinister. Biogen  has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved. Now it  is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a  problem:\n\nFDA advisory committee  voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then  saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently,  a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and  Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to  support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and  Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the  country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's  AD drug. This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you  to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no  other therapy on the market. Well, what happens if a new, more effective  medication shows up?\n\n**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**\n\nBack  to our Villian JT. JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the  initial \"Citizens Patetion\") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works. Why? I  speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous  whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried  about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in  profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is  more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer. There is  little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less. When that  happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug. Biogen already  has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to  rejuvenate the companies earnings. Then expediently and as expected,  Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.\n\nI  believe that is the root issue. Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become  furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam! A group of us have  gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to  investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).\n\n**Short term price action:**\n\n1. Im  expecting the SP to bounce. After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a  perfect overreaction play. If you dont know what Im talking about, you  can look up \"overreaction with reversion to the mean.\"\n2. Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within \"weeks to months.\"\n3. Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks. (\"Soon\" per Remi)\n4. Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.\n\n\\#SAVA's  float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted  with utilization of &gt;90%. It'll take very little to make SAVA move,  big. Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.\n\nI  have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on  SAVA. My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!). I'll  finish with one last piece of advice. Over 19 years of investing, my  most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading  and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment  by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further  propagated by \"experts\" tweeting and commenting with their hidden  agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual  published results, but apparently, her opinion counts? Comments of her  blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical  vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, \"oh, he sounds  smart, so he must be right.\" or \"That sounds complicated, he must be on  to something.\" In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical  details are fooling many. DFV saw something well before masses, and he  was paid handsomely for it.\n\nIf my  opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen,  then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in  with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs.  a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.\n\nI am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD before making any decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": -1}]}

However, even seasoned investors can find some use out of this by getting back to the basics. This quick guide isn't meant to focus on financial metrics, but in an effort to explore companies based on the world around us.\n\nPreface: This is directed for individuals that are just starting to invest, in hopes of empowering them to continue to grow upon the knowledge they learn on in this post! This is also a post to help highlight a new social investing platform I've been building called [Mainstreet](https://mainstreetportfolio.com/) (currently in beta) that helps you invest with your friends, track your portfolios, and build communities with one another. Happy investing!\n\n**How To Find Stocks (for the Normal Investor)**\n\nOne of the most common questions I get when talking to someone just getting into investing, is something along the lines of \u201cWhich stocks are good?\u201d or \u201cHow do I find stocks to invest in?\u201d. Some of the reasons individuals choose not to invest is due to the \u201clack of knowledge\u201d or perhaps they are \u201cintimidated by the market\u201d. These are all valid reasons to not invest, but I feel like by providing the education and resources to learn about these topics in an easy and digestible manner will help people overcome these barriers and feel empowered to take control of their wealth, whether it\u2019s through real estate, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll dive into some of the strategies and methods I used to help gain knowledge and insight when investing in the stock market. Keep in mind this is not the definitive guide, but it\u2019s steps that I took to help me become more financially literate about the stock market. Everyone\u2019s path to financial education is different and unique and this is only meant to provide a different perspective for someone just starting out.\n\n**Pay Attention to the World Around You**\n\nThe first thing I usually tell people is, start to observe the world around you and the businesses that are close to your network. You\u2019ll easily be able to find many companies if you start to shift your mindset and look at how the world functions.\n\nFirst, look at what kind of products or services you consume. Do you need to get your fix of vanilla latte at Starbucks ($SBUX) in the morning? More of a fast food person? Let\u2019s look at McDonalds ($MCD), Chipotle ($CMG), Shake Shack ($SHAK), or Restaurant Brands International ($QSR). Are you a hardcore gamer? Well, I\u2019m sure one of your games or consoles comes from Sony ($SNE), Nintendo ($NTDOY), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), or Microsoft ($MSFT). Or maybe you\u2019ve been working from home? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had to buy some products from Amazon ($AMZN) or Wayfair ($W) to spruce up your office space. You\u2019re probably also using things like Zoom ($ZM), Google Drive ($GOOG or $GOOGL), or Slack to keep yourself productive during the day.\n\n**Build a Watchlist**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got the brain working a little, it\u2019s important to start building a watchlist of all the stocks you\u2019ve thought of. You can use your broker watchlist tool, or even an app like Yahoo Finance, WeBull, etc. Sort them in a way that works for you, whether it\u2019s by sector (financial, tech, industrials), subsector (gaming, oil, e-commerce), or even by priority (Watchlist Tier 1, Watchlist Tier 2, etc.)\n\nOrganization is key when building your watchlist. You\u2019ll want to have them organized because it\u2019ll help you get a quick glance of what\u2019s happening in the market at any given time. By checking on the stocks you\u2019ve added to your watchlist periodically, you\u2019ll learn how they move according to catalysts (market news, earnings, etc) and be able to plan how and when you\u2019d like to invest in them.\n\n**Search within an Index Fund or ETF**\n\nA great way to search up companies is by looking at current index fund or ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) allocations. With index funds, you can look at the holdings of the S&amp;P500 (Top 500 American companies) or the Nasdaq 100 (Most active, largest 100 Nasdaq companies). At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of the S&amp;P500 are:\n\n1. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)\n2. Microsoft Corp ($MSFT)\n3. Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN)\n4. Facebook, Inc. ($FB)\n5. Alphabet Inc. Class A ($GOOGL)\n6. Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG)\n7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc ($BRK.B)\n8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ($JPM)\n9. Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA)\n10. Johnson &amp; Johnson ($JNJ)\n\nAnother way is to look into the holdings of an ETF. There are tons of ETFs out there that track indices like $SPY and $QQQ, which track the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, as well as more focused sector ETFs, like the ARK Innovation Fund ($ARKK) or the O\u2019Shares Global Internet Giants Fund ($OGIG).\n\nOne of my favorites is ARKK, as they focus on disruptive innovation and change. So, for example, if something like this was to resonate with you, looking into their top holdings will give you some insight on what kinds of companies you\u2019d need to do research on to gain exposure to this particular strategy. At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of ARKK are:\n\n1. Tesla, Inc ($TSLA)\n2. Teladoc Health, Inc. ($TDOC)\n3. Roku, Inc. ($ROKU)\n4. Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)\n5. Square, Inc. ($SQ)\n6. Shopify, Inc ($SHOP)\n7. Spotify Technology SA ($SPOT)\n8. Twilio, Inc (TWLO)\n9. Coinbase Global, Inc ($COIN)\n10. Unity Software, Inc ($U)\n\nHopefully looking into index funds or ETFs like the ones listed above help spark curiosity and the urge to build on your own knowledge!\n\n**Invest in Things You Understand (Personal, Business)**\n\nAnother piece of advice I like to give people is to only invest in areas of the market you understand. For example, if I see a sector like biotech or cybersecurity shoot up 50% in the last three months, but I don\u2019t really understand how this industry works, don\u2019t put your money in it. Simple as that. If the whole stock market started to fall, these will be the easiest to target as a potential sell because you don\u2019t understand the industry or the company at all. Your conviction on the stock is low so incentive to hold onto it for the long term is also low.\n\nFor me, I\u2019m a big gamer and I understand the industry well. To compare it to the previous example above, I can take those companies and further extrapolate to build upon my research using my existing knowledge. As a result, I\u2019m aware that gaming consoles use chips from Intel ($INTC), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), as well as GPU processors from Nvidia ($NVDA). Many video games are developed on software applications like Unity ($U). I\u2019m also aware that a large population of gamers and gaming companies come from Asia and Europe, therefore I can look into stocks like Ubisoft ($UBI), Capcom ($CCOEF), or even Tencent Holdings ($TCEHY). What about gaming accessories from Corsair ($CRSR) or Logitech ($LOGI)? And let\u2019s not forget about Gamestop ($GME)!\n\nAnother great way to leverage your knowledge is to look at your workplace and how the business is structured from within. Does your company utilize products or services from other companies? If you work at a software company, perhaps you use Cisco ($CSCO) or Ciena ($CIEN) for your networking. If your company uses customer or sales support, you may be using something like Salesforce ($CRM), Twilio ($TWLO), or Zendesk ($ZEN). To optimize your business, your company may also be leveraging cybersecurity services like Palo Alto ($PALO), Okta ($OKTA), or Crowdstrike ($CRWD). By looking within your own workplace, you\u2019ll be able to do a bit of deeper digging to find stocks that services businesses and aren\u2019t as customer facing.\n\nUnderstanding an industry well allows you to build your conviction in that industry. By fully grasping the ins and outs, you\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re invested in. This prevents panicking or selling if you suddenly see a red day, because you know what the company is fundamentally and potentially capable of. It also allows you to get invested in the companies you\u2019re buying, ultimately feeling like a small owner of the company, which is exactly what the function of stocks are.\n\n**Diversify your Portfolio**\n\nSo now, you\u2019ve done a bit of research and found a ton of stocks you might potentially invest in. Now what? Well, now is where you want to think about risk management and portfolio diversity.\n\nFrom Investopedia, diversification is a \u201crisk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\u201d\n\nHow do I know what\u2019s diversified enough? Great question, but that\u2019s up to your personal risk tolerance. Try not to allocate all your stocks into one single sector or area of the market. By broadening out in sector (tech, industrial), subsector (5G, banks), geography (US, Asia, Europe), market cap (large, medium, small), and more, you can feel comfortable and confident with your investments. The last thing you want to be doing is checking your stocks every minute and wondering if you should buy more or sell it off. Also consider the timeline of your allocations. The majority of my portfolio is in long-term investments (3+ years), but I do have a small portion of my portfolio allocated to mid-term and momentum investments (less than two years), such as options and swing trading. It\u2019s up to each individual investor to determine these allocations and stay committed to knowing when to change your allocation based on your time horizon.\n\nConsider this portfolio of $10000 dollars: (Stock, dollar amount\\[%\\], sector/subsector/geography/market cap)\n\n* Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA - $1000 (10%) - Tech / EV / USA / Large\n* Alibaba Group ($BABA) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / E-Commerce / ASIA / Large\n* Bank of America ($BAC) - $1000 (10%) - Financials / Banking / USA / Large\n* GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Pharma / EU / Large\n* Brookfield Renewable ($BEP)- $1000 (10%) - Energy / Renewable / CAN / Large\n* Papa John\u2019s Int. ($PZZA)- $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Consumer/ USA / Mid\n* Ubisoft Entertainment ($UBI) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / Gaming / EU / Mid\n* Barrick Gold ($GOLD) - $1000 (10%) - Industrials / Mining / CAN / Mid\n* Aurora Cannabis ($ACB) - $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Cannabis / CAN / Small\n* Nano-X Imaging ($NNOX) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Telehealth / Israel / Small\n\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve been able to allocate into many different sectors, subsectors, geographies, and market caps. If one of these companies were to disappear tomorrow, we\u2019d still have 90% of our portfolio remaining.\n\nOf our mock portfolio, our sector allocation is the following: 30% Technology, 20% Consumer, 20% Health, and 10% each in Financials, Energy, and Industrials. Our subsector allocation is fully diversified in 10 subsectors of the market: Electric Vehicles, E-Commerce, Banking, Pharma, Renewable Energy, Consumer, Gaming, Mining, Cannabis, and Telehealth. In terms of geography, our allocation is the following: 30% USA, 30% Canada, 20% Europe, 10% Asia, and 10% Israel. With our market cap, our allocation is the following: 50% large, 30% mid, and 20% small. As you can see, this portfolio is well diversified in terms of sector, subsector, region, and market cap. These allocations will ultimately be up to you, as you will be in control of your portfolio.\n\n**Now You\u2019re Ready!**\n\nAnd that\u2019s it, we\u2019ve learned how to find stocks by looking at your surroundings using your own knowledge from your personal and work life and now you understand how to properly diversify a portfolio based on your own risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\n**Mainstreet**\n\nThis article is part of a series of articles aimed at assisting investors to take control of their wealth on Mainstreet.

Im about to present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to 75x your  money\\*\\*.\\*\\* Too much, or too good to be true? Im being conservative. Hear  me out.\n\n**First, I shall Flex:**\n\n1. I  am an MD and a Professor. To spell out the obvious, I have insight into  what matters in the medical world. Many pure researchers lack this  (cough cough Elisabeth Bik). In addition, As medical school faculty, If I  can't figure it out, I know who to ask.\n2. I started investing (profitably) before most of you were born.\n\nWhy  flex? To make it abundantly clear, my opinion on biotech investing  matters just a little. With that said, once more, listen up!\n\n**The Pickle:**\n\nYou  youngins haven't noticed, but Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of  death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. The kicker is,  there is NO effective treatment.\n\nThe  FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm. This drug has  significant adverse events. The risk of brain swelling requires serial  Brain MRIs. It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV  infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k. Most incredible is  that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate  trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make  later).\n\nAgain, for emphasis, the  FDA still approved it because the need is that severe. President Biden  recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation  over a trillion dollars.\n\n**The Fix: $SAVA**\n\nCassava  Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive  function in its CMS trial. The degree and duration of improvement have  NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic.  It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that  behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it  doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the  discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.\n\nYes,  we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc. A genuine  criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased  critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the  usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives  conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the  ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.\n\nWithout  getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere  criticisms is Phase 3 trials. There is no valid argument against this  statement. This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use  absolute phrases. If you take away only one point from this article,  then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start  early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more  about him later). Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after  the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also  threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy. Be angry,  fellow apes, be angry. Im just getting started, BTW.\n\nDo  market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal?  They do. That is why the stock price went from &lt; $1 to an ATH of  $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my  family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the  first place.\n\n**The Villan and His Massacre:**\n\nJordan  Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a \"Citizens Petition.\"  A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit)  out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical  to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed  another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.\n\nEssentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second,  sold their shares. SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the  making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog ([https://ad-science.org/](https://ad-science.org/)),  Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it  biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.\n\n1. Jordan  Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that  patients are literally dying as they wait. WTF!? Why, why why?? If you  aren't angry, somethings wrong with you. JT states he is concerned for  patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there  is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected,  JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly.  In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did  JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that  is the \\*only\\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is  safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall  continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these  petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is  horrendous (3% success rate)? Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who  uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD  in its purest form.\n2. Then  why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous  document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe  even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my  position by 30%. With that said, Im not surprised the masses started  selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent,  it's an \\*opportunity\\*\u2014a second chance to buy the stock on clearance.\n\n**The Financials:**\n\n$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue.\n\nFifty  million patients are suffering from AD globally. 6 million of those  patients reside in the US. Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American  market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs  $20k annually, just a bit over a third the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's  soon to fail drug):\n\n1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000\n\nThat  calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up  as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment  options). The current stock price is $50. The overly conservative  valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750\n\nThe above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia.\n\n**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**\n\nIf  you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading  causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a  hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of  death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment.  Thats devastating for patients, but families? It's not uncommon for  families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they \"can't  handle it anymore.\" This market is massive and unaddressed! Severely,  painfully, and gravely unaddressed.\n\nI  have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires  (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process. JT is only the  face of this farce. Behind him are many short positions making a 100  million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their  short-term gain. There is something far more concerning.\n\n**The Plot Thickens:**\n\nWhat  I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or  short-term price action. There is something much more sinister. Biogen  has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved. Now it  is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a  problem:\n\nFDA advisory committee  voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then  saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently,  a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and  Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to  support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and  Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the  country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's  AD drug. This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you  to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no  other therapy on the market. Well, what happens if a new, more effective  medication shows up?\n\n**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**\n\nBack  to our Villian JT. JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the  initial \"Citizens Patetion\") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works. Why? I  speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous  whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried  about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in  profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is  more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer. There is  little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less. When that  happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug. Biogen already  has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to  rejuvenate the companies earnings. Then expediently and as expected,  Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.\n\nI  believe that is the root issue. Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become  furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam! A group of us have  gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to  investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).\n\n**Short term price action:**\n\n1. Im  expecting the SP to bounce. After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a  perfect overreaction play. If you dont know what Im talking about, you  can look up \"overreaction with reversion to the mean.\"\n2. Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within \"weeks to months.\"\n3. Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks. (\"Soon\" per Remi)\n4. Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.\n\n\\#SAVA's  float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted  with utilization of &gt;90%. It'll take very little to make SAVA move,  big. Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.\n\nI  have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on  SAVA. My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!). I'll  finish with one last piece of advice. Over 19 years of investing, my  most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading  and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment  by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further  propagated by \"experts\" tweeting and commenting with their hidden  agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual  published results, but apparently, her opinion counts? Comments of her  blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical  vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, \"oh, he sounds  smart, so he must be right.\" or \"That sounds complicated, he must be on  to something.\" In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical  details are fooling many. DFV saw something well before masses, and he  was paid handsomely for it.\n\nIf my  opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen,  then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in  with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs.  a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.\n\nI am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD before making any decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": -1}]}

This quick guide isn't meant to focus on financial metrics, but in an effort to explore companies based on the world around us.\n\nPreface: This is directed for individuals that are just starting to invest, in hopes of empowering them to continue to grow upon the knowledge they learn on in this post! This is also a post to help highlight a new social investing platform I've been building called [Mainstreet](https://mainstreetportfolio.com/) (currently in beta) that helps you invest with your friends, track your portfolios, and build communities with one another. Happy investing!\n\n**How To Find Stocks (for the Normal Investor)**\n\nOne of the most common questions I get when talking to someone just getting into investing, is something along the lines of \u201cWhich stocks are good?\u201d or \u201cHow do I find stocks to invest in?\u201d. Some of the reasons individuals choose not to invest is due to the \u201clack of knowledge\u201d or perhaps they are \u201cintimidated by the market\u201d. These are all valid reasons to not invest, but I feel like by providing the education and resources to learn about these topics in an easy and digestible manner will help people overcome these barriers and feel empowered to take control of their wealth, whether it\u2019s through real estate, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll dive into some of the strategies and methods I used to help gain knowledge and insight when investing in the stock market. Keep in mind this is not the definitive guide, but it\u2019s steps that I took to help me become more financially literate about the stock market. Everyone\u2019s path to financial education is different and unique and this is only meant to provide a different perspective for someone just starting out.\n\n**Pay Attention to the World Around You**\n\nThe first thing I usually tell people is, start to observe the world around you and the businesses that are close to your network. You\u2019ll easily be able to find many companies if you start to shift your mindset and look at how the world functions.\n\nFirst, look at what kind of products or services you consume. Do you need to get your fix of vanilla latte at Starbucks ($SBUX) in the morning? More of a fast food person? Let\u2019s look at McDonalds ($MCD), Chipotle ($CMG), Shake Shack ($SHAK), or Restaurant Brands International ($QSR). Are you a hardcore gamer? Well, I\u2019m sure one of your games or consoles comes from Sony ($SNE), Nintendo ($NTDOY), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), or Microsoft ($MSFT). Or maybe you\u2019ve been working from home? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had to buy some products from Amazon ($AMZN) or Wayfair ($W) to spruce up your office space. You\u2019re probably also using things like Zoom ($ZM), Google Drive ($GOOG or $GOOGL), or Slack to keep yourself productive during the day.\n\n**Build a Watchlist**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got the brain working a little, it\u2019s important to start building a watchlist of all the stocks you\u2019ve thought of. You can use your broker watchlist tool, or even an app like Yahoo Finance, WeBull, etc. Sort them in a way that works for you, whether it\u2019s by sector (financial, tech, industrials), subsector (gaming, oil, e-commerce), or even by priority (Watchlist Tier 1, Watchlist Tier 2, etc.)\n\nOrganization is key when building your watchlist. You\u2019ll want to have them organized because it\u2019ll help you get a quick glance of what\u2019s happening in the market at any given time. By checking on the stocks you\u2019ve added to your watchlist periodically, you\u2019ll learn how they move according to catalysts (market news, earnings, etc) and be able to plan how and when you\u2019d like to invest in them.\n\n**Search within an Index Fund or ETF**\n\nA great way to search up companies is by looking at current index fund or ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) allocations. With index funds, you can look at the holdings of the S&amp;P500 (Top 500 American companies) or the Nasdaq 100 (Most active, largest 100 Nasdaq companies). At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of the S&amp;P500 are:\n\n1. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)\n2. Microsoft Corp ($MSFT)\n3. Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN)\n4. Facebook, Inc. ($FB)\n5. Alphabet Inc. Class A ($GOOGL)\n6. Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG)\n7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc ($BRK.B)\n8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ($JPM)\n9. Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA)\n10. Johnson &amp; Johnson ($JNJ)\n\nAnother way is to look into the holdings of an ETF. There are tons of ETFs out there that track indices like $SPY and $QQQ, which track the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, as well as more focused sector ETFs, like the ARK Innovation Fund ($ARKK) or the O\u2019Shares Global Internet Giants Fund ($OGIG).\n\nOne of my favorites is ARKK, as they focus on disruptive innovation and change. So, for example, if something like this was to resonate with you, looking into their top holdings will give you some insight on what kinds of companies you\u2019d need to do research on to gain exposure to this particular strategy. At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of ARKK are:\n\n1. Tesla, Inc ($TSLA)\n2. Teladoc Health, Inc. ($TDOC)\n3. Roku, Inc. ($ROKU)\n4. Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)\n5. Square, Inc. ($SQ)\n6. Shopify, Inc ($SHOP)\n7. Spotify Technology SA ($SPOT)\n8. Twilio, Inc (TWLO)\n9. Coinbase Global, Inc ($COIN)\n10. Unity Software, Inc ($U)\n\nHopefully looking into index funds or ETFs like the ones listed above help spark curiosity and the urge to build on your own knowledge!\n\n**Invest in Things You Understand (Personal, Business)**\n\nAnother piece of advice I like to give people is to only invest in areas of the market you understand. For example, if I see a sector like biotech or cybersecurity shoot up 50% in the last three months, but I don\u2019t really understand how this industry works, don\u2019t put your money in it. Simple as that. If the whole stock market started to fall, these will be the easiest to target as a potential sell because you don\u2019t understand the industry or the company at all. Your conviction on the stock is low so incentive to hold onto it for the long term is also low.\n\nFor me, I\u2019m a big gamer and I understand the industry well. To compare it to the previous example above, I can take those companies and further extrapolate to build upon my research using my existing knowledge. As a result, I\u2019m aware that gaming consoles use chips from Intel ($INTC), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), as well as GPU processors from Nvidia ($NVDA). Many video games are developed on software applications like Unity ($U). I\u2019m also aware that a large population of gamers and gaming companies come from Asia and Europe, therefore I can look into stocks like Ubisoft ($UBI), Capcom ($CCOEF), or even Tencent Holdings ($TCEHY). What about gaming accessories from Corsair ($CRSR) or Logitech ($LOGI)? And let\u2019s not forget about Gamestop ($GME)!\n\nAnother great way to leverage your knowledge is to look at your workplace and how the business is structured from within. Does your company utilize products or services from other companies? If you work at a software company, perhaps you use Cisco ($CSCO) or Ciena ($CIEN) for your networking. If your company uses customer or sales support, you may be using something like Salesforce ($CRM), Twilio ($TWLO), or Zendesk ($ZEN). To optimize your business, your company may also be leveraging cybersecurity services like Palo Alto ($PALO), Okta ($OKTA), or Crowdstrike ($CRWD). By looking within your own workplace, you\u2019ll be able to do a bit of deeper digging to find stocks that services businesses and aren\u2019t as customer facing.\n\nUnderstanding an industry well allows you to build your conviction in that industry. By fully grasping the ins and outs, you\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re invested in. This prevents panicking or selling if you suddenly see a red day, because you know what the company is fundamentally and potentially capable of. It also allows you to get invested in the companies you\u2019re buying, ultimately feeling like a small owner of the company, which is exactly what the function of stocks are.\n\n**Diversify your Portfolio**\n\nSo now, you\u2019ve done a bit of research and found a ton of stocks you might potentially invest in. Now what? Well, now is where you want to think about risk management and portfolio diversity.\n\nFrom Investopedia, diversification is a \u201crisk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\u201d\n\nHow do I know what\u2019s diversified enough? Great question, but that\u2019s up to your personal risk tolerance. Try not to allocate all your stocks into one single sector or area of the market. By broadening out in sector (tech, industrial), subsector (5G, banks), geography (US, Asia, Europe), market cap (large, medium, small), and more, you can feel comfortable and confident with your investments. The last thing you want to be doing is checking your stocks every minute and wondering if you should buy more or sell it off. Also consider the timeline of your allocations. The majority of my portfolio is in long-term investments (3+ years), but I do have a small portion of my portfolio allocated to mid-term and momentum investments (less than two years), such as options and swing trading. It\u2019s up to each individual investor to determine these allocations and stay committed to knowing when to change your allocation based on your time horizon.\n\nConsider this portfolio of $10000 dollars: (Stock, dollar amount\\[%\\], sector/subsector/geography/market cap)\n\n* Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA - $1000 (10%) - Tech / EV / USA / Large\n* Alibaba Group ($BABA) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / E-Commerce / ASIA / Large\n* Bank of America ($BAC) - $1000 (10%) - Financials / Banking / USA / Large\n* GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Pharma / EU / Large\n* Brookfield Renewable ($BEP)- $1000 (10%) - Energy / Renewable / CAN / Large\n* Papa John\u2019s Int. ($PZZA)- $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Consumer/ USA / Mid\n* Ubisoft Entertainment ($UBI) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / Gaming / EU / Mid\n* Barrick Gold ($GOLD) - $1000 (10%) - Industrials / Mining / CAN / Mid\n* Aurora Cannabis ($ACB) - $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Cannabis / CAN / Small\n* Nano-X Imaging ($NNOX) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Telehealth / Israel / Small\n\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve been able to allocate into many different sectors, subsectors, geographies, and market caps. If one of these companies were to disappear tomorrow, we\u2019d still have 90% of our portfolio remaining.\n\nOf our mock portfolio, our sector allocation is the following: 30% Technology, 20% Consumer, 20% Health, and 10% each in Financials, Energy, and Industrials. Our subsector allocation is fully diversified in 10 subsectors of the market: Electric Vehicles, E-Commerce, Banking, Pharma, Renewable Energy, Consumer, Gaming, Mining, Cannabis, and Telehealth. In terms of geography, our allocation is the following: 30% USA, 30% Canada, 20% Europe, 10% Asia, and 10% Israel. With our market cap, our allocation is the following: 50% large, 30% mid, and 20% small. As you can see, this portfolio is well diversified in terms of sector, subsector, region, and market cap. These allocations will ultimately be up to you, as you will be in control of your portfolio.\n\n**Now You\u2019re Ready!**\n\nAnd that\u2019s it, we\u2019ve learned how to find stocks by looking at your surroundings using your own knowledge from your personal and work life and now you understand how to properly diversify a portfolio based on your own risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\n**Mainstreet**\n\nThis article is part of a series of articles aimed at assisting investors to take control of their wealth on Mainstreet.

Here is my write up with sources. \n\nBackground:  KAVL is a public US company. They distribute Bibi Sticks and Bidi Pouches (Product line about to launch soon). The reason the company is structured like this is because Bidi is a foreign manufacturer of vape / tobacco products. It is against US regulations for a foreign manufacturer of these type of products to distribute directly in the US. So KAVL being public in the US is allowed to distribute in the US.  \n\n\n1. Kaival Brands Innovations Group Inc. is poised To Benefit From Ongoing Shift Away From Combustible Tobacco Products:   \n\\- To summarize, KAVL has been extremely diligent, making sure their product passes FDA regulation. Many of their competitors fail to do this. It is my assumption that the FDA grants grace periods for new vape products entering the market. Many companies pump during their grace period, then dissolve and restructure. You have seen this with Puff &gt;Fume and other similar companies. KAVL has built their company around making sure they meet FDA regulations so they can build their product and brand.   \nSources:   \n\\- [https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/kaival-brands-positions-to-rival-big-tobacco-as-new-regulations-squeeze-competition-bidi-pouch-sets-for-september-launch-otcmkts-kavl](https://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/kaival-brands-positions-to-rival-big-tobacco-as-new-regulations-squeeze-competition-bidi-pouch-sets-for-september-launch-otcmkts-kavl)  \n\\- [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kaival-brands-applauds-fdas-continued-enforcement-against-unauthorized-ends-products-301357652.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kaival-brands-applauds-fdas-continued-enforcement-against-unauthorized-ends-products-301357652.html)  \n\\- [https://ir.kaivalbrands.com/news/news-details/2021/Kaival-Brands-OTCQB-KAVL-Bidi-Vapor-Announces-Issuance-of-New-U.S.-Patents/default.aspx](https://ir.kaivalbrands.com/news/news-details/2021/Kaival-Brands-OTCQB-KAVL-Bidi-Vapor-Announces-Issuance-of-New-U.S.-Patents/default.aspx)  \n\n2.

They took a hit after the last Quarterly Reporting.   \n \"Kaival Brands recognizes revenue in two ways, which is similar to other consumer product brands.

In addition, the Company has some contracts with 120-day payment terms, which is common practice when working with larger wholesalers and distributors. With respect to these types of orders, Kaival Brands fulfills and ships the entire product order upfront to the distributor, and then receives payment for products upon sale of the product by the wholesale or distributor, as applicable, payable on a recurring monthly basis. This payment cycle lasts 120-days.

Stock prices typically fall during a recession, so it\u2019s a good time to look for stocks that traditionally remain strong even when GDP falls.\n\nThe types of stocks that do better in a recession are typically those of companies that provide goods and services that are less price sensitive \u2014 in other words, things that people will buy even if they increase in price, or if the consumer fears losing their job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThese fall into industries like consumer staples, healthcare, utilities.\n\n**Consumer Staples**\n\n**Coca-Cola**\n\nThe Coca-Cola Co.

An investment\u2019s ESG score measures the sustainability of an investment in three specific categories: environmental, social and corporate governance.\n\nInvestors interested in environmental, social and governance issues often cite climate concerns as guiding their ESG investments.\n\nThey were rewarded during the market crash as oil prices cratered. In the first quarter, sustainability-focused funds held up better than the broader fund market during the initial bear market sell-off \u2013 driven in part by less exposure to fossil fuel energy.\n\nThat said, ESG goes beyond not buying petroleum companies; there's the \"S\" and the \"G\" parts, too, and those may take greater prominence as people focus on health care amid the pandemic and the social unrest triggered by systemic racism.\n\nThe global sustainable fund universe attracted $45.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020, versus an outflow of $384.7 billion from the overall fund universe. In the U.S. specifically, the research firm found that in the first quarter, flows into open-end and sustainable ETFs reached $10.5 billion, eclipsing the previous record set in 2019's fourth quarter.\n\nA June survey in 2020 from global investment manager Nuveen showed high-net-worth investors are starting to choose ESG for its outperformance, in addition to having a positive social impact, with 53% of respondents citing returns as their top reason to invest in ESG.\n\nAs such, it seems to be a wise choice to get started on an ESG portfolio. Here are some picks to get you started.\n\n***Coca-Cola (KO)***\n\nAs a mega-cap stock with a current market value around $250 billion, Coca-Cola has already partially recovered from the loss in sales due to the pandemic. Analysts suggest that by providing a dividend yield of approximately 3.1%, Coca-Cola makes the list of the top recovery stocks of 2021.\n\nMoreover, if you\u2019re looking for companies that strictly adhere to ESG policies, Coca-Cola has an AA rating from MSCI. The company performs exceptionally well when it comes to waste management, ensuring health and safety standards, and controlling the carbon footprint per product.\n\nThese attributes make it one of the leading ESG dividend stock companies in the beverage industry. Interestingly, only 15% have an AA rating from MSCI, while only 9% have a higher AAA rating.\n\n***Honeywell (HON)***\n\nHoneywell is an ESG-compliant company that shows high growth potential due to its share-price appreciation.\n\nThe Street predicts around 11% annual average growth for the company in the next few years, with a strong \u2018Buy\u2019 rating. Honeywell has consistently raised its dividends since 2014, going up from 45 cents per share to 95 cents last year.\n\nAs far as ESG compliance is concerned, Honeywell holds an AA rating from MSCI. Offering a dividend yield of 1.6%, Honeywell maintains its ESG rating among 14% of its industry peers, having the AA rating.\n\n***NVIDIA (NVDA)***\n\nThis is a well-known company producing graphics and video processing cards, remained unaffected by the pandemic. Analysts suggest that the company is bound to face the most prominent growth rate in the tech sector, surpassing artificial intelligence and auto technology. On the ESG end, NVIDIA is highly rated because of its mineral policy and effective corporate governance. The company uses rare minerals to build its chips and cards; therefore, it has a stringent policy against unethical procurement and mining of these minerals.\n\n***Chr. Hansen (CHYHY)***\n\nThe Danish human nutrition giant Chr. Hansen ranks high in ESG compliance due to its sustainable practices regarding food security and waste management. The company mainly produces bacteria that help curb the extended use of harmful pesticides while increasing crop yield at the same time.\n\nMoreover, Chr. Hansen has successfully developed an accounting system according to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. This helps the company assess the impact of each product and display the metrics to investors.\n\nThese extra measures place Chr. Hansen in the first place on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations List.\n\n***MBH Corporation (MBHCF)***\n\nMBH is a holding company actively building a portfolio of profitable, earnings accretive, debt-free small to medium enterprises (SME) that are expected to have a higher-than-normal growth profile as part of a larger organization. The company's operating model leaves management of the acquired companies to operate autonomously and fully accountable to develop and grow their businesses. As part of a larger organization, the acquired companies and in turn, MBH get the benefits of both worlds. This small holding company may have just started out, but it is pumping out revenue steadily and healthily and pays a 2% dividend. MBH Corporation has won five stars for their ESG credentials, getting into the top 1% of the nearly 2,000 businesses in the Support the Goals database. They have achieved this level of commitment through their work with inequality and climate goals. Support the Goals encourages businesses to take responsibility and the organisation expects companies 'to demonstrate how you support the world\u2019s most important action plan'.\n\n***NextEra Energy (NEE)***\n\nNextEra is the largest electric utility by market cap. Over the last few decades, the company has been consistently reducing its emissions through increased renewable energy use. Its CO2 emissions are 55% less than those of an average US utility. NextEra has now set an ambitious goal of reducing CO2 emissions, by 2025, by 67% from its 2005 base levels. This goal effectively means that absolute CO2 emissions would go down by 40% even while NextEra\u2019s energy production would double during that time. To its credit, the company last year received a best-in-class preparedness assessment by S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 ESG Evaluation. NextEra has, essentially, received the highest ranking given by S&amp;P to a company within the utility sector.\n\n***Microsoft (MSFT)***\n\nMicrosoft has taken the lead in its commitment towards carbon mitigation by becoming the first company among its peers to target \u201ccarbon negative\u201d status by 2030. It has created a $1 billion fund to reduce emissions and start clearing carbon. This ambitious commitment is unprecedented and sets Microsoft apart from its entire sector. Microsoft received the highest ESG rating of AAA from MSCI ESG Research in September 2019.\n\n***Prologis (PLD)***\n\nPrologis is a logistics-focused REIT with multiple \u201cfirst company to\u2026\u201d accomplishments in the ESG space. Prologis is the first real estate company to issue green bonds. It is also the first real estate company to be awarded the WELL certification by the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI). Additionally, Prologis is the first logistics company to receive approved SBTs or \u201cScience-Based Targets\u201d necessary to meet the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement of 2015. The company ranks highly on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World list and on the Investor\u2019s Business Daily (IBD) 50 Best ESG Companies list."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 1}]}

Like much of the global economy, the agricultural industry has been affected by COVID-19, but it\u2019s made an impressive recovery as commodity prices have soared in several categories. A number of agriculture exchange-traded funds, such as iShares MSCI Agriculture Producers ETF (VEGI), now trade at around their all-time highs.\n\nToday, agribusiness is a big one, touching a wide array of industries. The scale required for operations has led to market power being concentrated in a handful of titans. These companies, many with healthy profits, cash flows, and dividends offer excellent opportunities for investors. However, complementing the agroGiants are also a handful of emerging markets featuring an array of very innovative companies. As producers of basic food, many agricultural stocks are considered consumer staples/defensives, meaning that demand for their product is not affected by localized perturbations or background volatility in the broader economy. \n\nVertical farming is a good example of one of the latest emerging agricultural technologies to hit the market. Investors are betting big on stocks such as AppHarvest and Local Bounti (NYSE: LOCL), a hybrid between vertical farming and hydroponics. In vertical farming, companies use shelves and artificial light to grow produce, minimizing space and water consumption. By conserving space, vertical farming has the potential to create facilities that are located much closer to consumers. AppHarvest promises to do just that as the Kentucky-based company says it serves consumers within a one-day drive of its facilities. This compares favorably to conventional produce that is often imported from abroad or shipped from California.\n\nNow let's talk about cellular agriculture. Cultured meat, also known as cultivated or cell-based meat, eliminates the need to breed, raise, and slaughter animals, reducing the environmental impact of traditional meat production. Compared to traditional meat production, cultured meat produced with renewable energy reduces the impact of global warming. It also substantially lowers the usage of land.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7cnki96g83t81.png?width=588&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e49306078ff8d13e47f0944b519f3f22a20f106\n\nCultured meat is manufactured utilizing cell culture procedures in a laboratory or manufacturing facility, employing master cells obtained from cattle, chicken, pigs, fish, and lamb and other forms of livestock and seafood. The concept has been in existence since the early 2000s and is expected to gain popularity as an alternative protein source in the coming years.\n\nThe global cultured meat market will be valued at $214 million in 2025. The cultured meat market is still a nascent industry, but Research &amp; Markets claims that by 2040, 60% of meat consumed globally will be produced from cells grown in bioreactors. Currently, nearly half of consumers have no reservations about eating cultured meat. Therefore bringing cultured meat to a major disruptor of the conventional meat market over the next 10 to 20 years.\n\nMeatech 3D (MITC) is an Israeli deep-tech food company developing slaughter-free meat products using advanced 3D bioprinting and tissue technology as an alternative to industrialized animal farming. To create REAL meat. In 2021, the company reported a net loss of $17.8 million and had cash and equivalents of $19.2 million bringing them to good start for a company in such early stages. \n\nJust last year the company successfully 3D printed a 3.67 oz cultivated steak primarily composed of cultivated real fat and muscle tissue without soy or pea protein THE biggest of its kind. MeaTech has celebrity backing from the likes of Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher who is helping the company become the market leader in cultured meat manufacturing.\n\nMeaTech has also acquired Peace of Meat, a leading developer of cultured chicken fat biomass based in Belgium, to diversify its bovine-oriented technologies and accelerate its entry into the market. On top of that, they recently signed a term sheet to establish a pilot plant and R&amp;D facility in Belgium to scale cultured fat development and accelerate market entry. In the long run, this expansion will be critical in the development and advancement of cultured meat, while in the short run, it will position MeaTech as a possible leader in the hybrid products market.\n\nHumans have made tremendous progress in reducing famine and food shortages in the past 70 years, but that doesn\u2019t make food security any less important in the 21st century. A rapidly expanding global middle class and increasing population are likely to raise caloric demand and shift preferences to more protein-heavy foods. It will require some new technologies to meet this challenge, and agricultural companies like those above are hard at work on these projects.

However, lower prices are good for consumers and good for fighting inflation.\n\nHope you enjoyed this commentary.

Heitzmann liked this tweet from the co-founder of Shopify (who he is heavily invested in) that touches on the popularity of NFTs and them trying to allow for their merchants to sell NFTs.\n* [https://twitter.com/harleyf/status/1419706363161231361?s=20](https://twitter.com/harleyf/status/1419706363161231361?s=20)\n* \ud83d\udcf7\n* \u201cIf you\u2019ve spent 1 minute on the internet this year, you\u2019ve seen a lot about NFTs directly through their stores, with one of the first being the [u/ChicagoBulls](https://www.reddit.com/u/ChicagoBulls/) NFT store\u201d Although he mentioned that merchants now can sell on there sites, many of the people on OpenSea are individuals so this won\u2019t apply for most of the people. This shows that the movement is massive enough that a 100B+ company like Shopify is looking at this space. If FirstMark can strike a deal with OpenSea, we can see an integration with Shopify.\n* Another tweet that Heitzmann liked recently is about the next era of social networks which is the NFT world led by OpenSea.\n* [https://twitter.com/scottbelsky/status/1436415358487961608?s=20](https://twitter.com/scottbelsky/status/1436415358487961608?s=20)\n* \ud83d\udcf7\n* Heitzmann is connected to crypto and has large investments that paid off big time in the social network space with Pinterest. If he believes NFTs are the next era, wouldn\u2019t he want to get in on OpenSea? The answer is yes.\n* As for the other manager and founder of FirstMark, Amish Jani has been actively liking many tweets that tie back to OpenSea. First, OpenSea recently was crowned a Unicorn in the last raise which is the milestone that FirstMark typically invests in.

Heitzmann and Jeff Jordan have a connection and have been seen in the same articles involving Pinterest.\n* These 2 have absolutely had meetings surrounding the Pinterest business considering they both represent massive VC firms that backed this massive tech company and hold substantial stake. They could have also had discussions around other investments like OpenSea which is one of the hottest private companies at the moment.\n\n1. **No problem working on projects together**\n\n* [Playbyte\u2019s new app aims to become the \u2018TikTok for games\u2019 | TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/03/playbytes-new-app-aims-to-become-the-tiktok-for-games/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29)\n* \u201cPlaybyte founder and CEO Kyle Russell \u2014 previously of Skydio, Andreessen Horowitz and (disclosure!)

We are 37 people handling 98% of all NFT volume.\u201d They are so desperate to find people that they are offering a 1 Ether bonus just for connecting them to someone. \u201cReferral bonus: Will pay 1 Ether to anyone who connects us to engineers or designers that we hire. Resumes to [opensearoles@gmail.com](mailto:opensearoles@gmail.com).\u201d\n* Lack of employees even after the funding round meaning they still do not have enough cash.\n* Even after the 100m raise they will still need more money. They could be more than just a marketplace if they were injected with nearly 1B from FirstMark at a $5B valuation.\n\n1. **Why does OpenSea need FMACs management**\n\n* Most recently, OpenSea has come under fire for \u201cinsider trading\u201d by an executive buying into drops before others had access. Nate C was a loved and trusted member of the crypto twitter and nft community, and since he's gone there is a big spot that needs to be filled.\n* This is making it clear that OpenSea has management issues that can be fixed with a spac merger that involves one of the best VC managers in Heitzmann and the Firstmark team\n* Although this is a bad look, the company is rolling out an app making them more legit in the eyes of the SEC and having this exec gone allows them to get away from the legal trouble.\n\n1. **OpenSea and FirstMark Horizon headquarters are a few blocks away**\n\n* FirstMark Horizon headquarters - 100 5th Ave, 3rd Floor New York, New York 10011\n* OpenSea headquarters - 105 East 24th Street, Apartment 4D, New York, New York 10010"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 0}]}

However, even seasoned investors can find some use out of this by getting back to the basics. This quick guide isn't meant to focus on financial metrics, but in an effort to explore companies based on the world around us.\n\nPreface: This is directed for individuals that are just starting to invest, in hopes of empowering them to continue to grow upon the knowledge they learn on in this post! This is also a post to help highlight a new social investing platform I've been building called [Mainstreet](https://mainstreetportfolio.com/) (currently in beta) that helps you invest with your friends, track your portfolios, and build communities with one another. Happy investing!\n\n**How To Find Stocks (for the Normal Investor)**\n\nOne of the most common questions I get when talking to someone just getting into investing, is something along the lines of \u201cWhich stocks are good?\u201d or \u201cHow do I find stocks to invest in?\u201d. Some of the reasons individuals choose not to invest is due to the \u201clack of knowledge\u201d or perhaps they are \u201cintimidated by the market\u201d. These are all valid reasons to not invest, but I feel like by providing the education and resources to learn about these topics in an easy and digestible manner will help people overcome these barriers and feel empowered to take control of their wealth, whether it\u2019s through real estate, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll dive into some of the strategies and methods I used to help gain knowledge and insight when investing in the stock market. Keep in mind this is not the definitive guide, but it\u2019s steps that I took to help me become more financially literate about the stock market. Everyone\u2019s path to financial education is different and unique and this is only meant to provide a different perspective for someone just starting out.\n\n**Pay Attention to the World Around You**\n\nThe first thing I usually tell people is, start to observe the world around you and the businesses that are close to your network. You\u2019ll easily be able to find many companies if you start to shift your mindset and look at how the world functions.\n\nFirst, look at what kind of products or services you consume. Do you need to get your fix of vanilla latte at Starbucks ($SBUX) in the morning? More of a fast food person? Let\u2019s look at McDonalds ($MCD), Chipotle ($CMG), Shake Shack ($SHAK), or Restaurant Brands International ($QSR). Are you a hardcore gamer? Well, I\u2019m sure one of your games or consoles comes from Sony ($SNE), Nintendo ($NTDOY), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), or Microsoft ($MSFT). Or maybe you\u2019ve been working from home? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had to buy some products from Amazon ($AMZN) or Wayfair ($W) to spruce up your office space. You\u2019re probably also using things like Zoom ($ZM), Google Drive ($GOOG or $GOOGL), or Slack to keep yourself productive during the day.\n\n**Build a Watchlist**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got the brain working a little, it\u2019s important to start building a watchlist of all the stocks you\u2019ve thought of. You can use your broker watchlist tool, or even an app like Yahoo Finance, WeBull, etc. Sort them in a way that works for you, whether it\u2019s by sector (financial, tech, industrials), subsector (gaming, oil, e-commerce), or even by priority (Watchlist Tier 1, Watchlist Tier 2, etc.)\n\nOrganization is key when building your watchlist. You\u2019ll want to have them organized because it\u2019ll help you get a quick glance of what\u2019s happening in the market at any given time. By checking on the stocks you\u2019ve added to your watchlist periodically, you\u2019ll learn how they move according to catalysts (market news, earnings, etc) and be able to plan how and when you\u2019d like to invest in them.\n\n**Search within an Index Fund or ETF**\n\nA great way to search up companies is by looking at current index fund or ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) allocations. With index funds, you can look at the holdings of the S&amp;P500 (Top 500 American companies) or the Nasdaq 100 (Most active, largest 100 Nasdaq companies). At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of the S&amp;P500 are:\n\n1. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)\n2. Microsoft Corp ($MSFT)\n3. Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN)\n4. Facebook, Inc. ($FB)\n5. Alphabet Inc. Class A ($GOOGL)\n6. Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG)\n7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc ($BRK.B)\n8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ($JPM)\n9. Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA)\n10. Johnson &amp; Johnson ($JNJ)\n\nAnother way is to look into the holdings of an ETF. There are tons of ETFs out there that track indices like $SPY and $QQQ, which track the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, as well as more focused sector ETFs, like the ARK Innovation Fund ($ARKK) or the O\u2019Shares Global Internet Giants Fund ($OGIG).\n\nOne of my favorites is ARKK, as they focus on disruptive innovation and change. So, for example, if something like this was to resonate with you, looking into their top holdings will give you some insight on what kinds of companies you\u2019d need to do research on to gain exposure to this particular strategy. At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of ARKK are:\n\n1. Tesla, Inc ($TSLA)\n2. Teladoc Health, Inc. ($TDOC)\n3. Roku, Inc. ($ROKU)\n4. Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)\n5. Square, Inc. ($SQ)\n6. Shopify, Inc ($SHOP)\n7. Spotify Technology SA ($SPOT)\n8. Twilio, Inc (TWLO)\n9. Coinbase Global, Inc ($COIN)\n10. Unity Software, Inc ($U)\n\nHopefully looking into index funds or ETFs like the ones listed above help spark curiosity and the urge to build on your own knowledge!\n\n**Invest in Things You Understand (Personal, Business)**\n\nAnother piece of advice I like to give people is to only invest in areas of the market you understand. For example, if I see a sector like biotech or cybersecurity shoot up 50% in the last three months, but I don\u2019t really understand how this industry works, don\u2019t put your money in it. Simple as that. If the whole stock market started to fall, these will be the easiest to target as a potential sell because you don\u2019t understand the industry or the company at all. Your conviction on the stock is low so incentive to hold onto it for the long term is also low.\n\nFor me, I\u2019m a big gamer and I understand the industry well. To compare it to the previous example above, I can take those companies and further extrapolate to build upon my research using my existing knowledge. As a result, I\u2019m aware that gaming consoles use chips from Intel ($INTC), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), as well as GPU processors from Nvidia ($NVDA). Many video games are developed on software applications like Unity ($U). I\u2019m also aware that a large population of gamers and gaming companies come from Asia and Europe, therefore I can look into stocks like Ubisoft ($UBI), Capcom ($CCOEF), or even Tencent Holdings ($TCEHY). What about gaming accessories from Corsair ($CRSR) or Logitech ($LOGI)? And let\u2019s not forget about Gamestop ($GME)!\n\nAnother great way to leverage your knowledge is to look at your workplace and how the business is structured from within. Does your company utilize products or services from other companies? If you work at a software company, perhaps you use Cisco ($CSCO) or Ciena ($CIEN) for your networking. If your company uses customer or sales support, you may be using something like Salesforce ($CRM), Twilio ($TWLO), or Zendesk ($ZEN). To optimize your business, your company may also be leveraging cybersecurity services like Palo Alto ($PALO), Okta ($OKTA), or Crowdstrike ($CRWD). By looking within your own workplace, you\u2019ll be able to do a bit of deeper digging to find stocks that services businesses and aren\u2019t as customer facing.\n\nUnderstanding an industry well allows you to build your conviction in that industry. By fully grasping the ins and outs, you\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re invested in. This prevents panicking or selling if you suddenly see a red day, because you know what the company is fundamentally and potentially capable of. It also allows you to get invested in the companies you\u2019re buying, ultimately feeling like a small owner of the company, which is exactly what the function of stocks are.\n\n**Diversify your Portfolio**\n\nSo now, you\u2019ve done a bit of research and found a ton of stocks you might potentially invest in. Now what? Well, now is where you want to think about risk management and portfolio diversity.\n\nFrom Investopedia, diversification is a \u201crisk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\u201d\n\nHow do I know what\u2019s diversified enough? Great question, but that\u2019s up to your personal risk tolerance. Try not to allocate all your stocks into one single sector or area of the market. By broadening out in sector (tech, industrial), subsector (5G, banks), geography (US, Asia, Europe), market cap (large, medium, small), and more, you can feel comfortable and confident with your investments. The last thing you want to be doing is checking your stocks every minute and wondering if you should buy more or sell it off. Also consider the timeline of your allocations. The majority of my portfolio is in long-term investments (3+ years), but I do have a small portion of my portfolio allocated to mid-term and momentum investments (less than two years), such as options and swing trading. It\u2019s up to each individual investor to determine these allocations and stay committed to knowing when to change your allocation based on your time horizon.\n\nConsider this portfolio of $10000 dollars: (Stock, dollar amount\\[%\\], sector/subsector/geography/market cap)\n\n* Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA - $1000 (10%) - Tech / EV / USA / Large\n* Alibaba Group ($BABA) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / E-Commerce / ASIA / Large\n* Bank of America ($BAC) - $1000 (10%) - Financials / Banking / USA / Large\n* GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Pharma / EU / Large\n* Brookfield Renewable ($BEP)- $1000 (10%) - Energy / Renewable / CAN / Large\n* Papa John\u2019s Int. ($PZZA)- $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Consumer/ USA / Mid\n* Ubisoft Entertainment ($UBI) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / Gaming / EU / Mid\n* Barrick Gold ($GOLD) - $1000 (10%) - Industrials / Mining / CAN / Mid\n* Aurora Cannabis ($ACB) - $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Cannabis / CAN / Small\n* Nano-X Imaging ($NNOX) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Telehealth / Israel / Small\n\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve been able to allocate into many different sectors, subsectors, geographies, and market caps. If one of these companies were to disappear tomorrow, we\u2019d still have 90% of our portfolio remaining.\n\nOf our mock portfolio, our sector allocation is the following: 30% Technology, 20% Consumer, 20% Health, and 10% each in Financials, Energy, and Industrials. Our subsector allocation is fully diversified in 10 subsectors of the market: Electric Vehicles, E-Commerce, Banking, Pharma, Renewable Energy, Consumer, Gaming, Mining, Cannabis, and Telehealth. In terms of geography, our allocation is the following: 30% USA, 30% Canada, 20% Europe, 10% Asia, and 10% Israel. With our market cap, our allocation is the following: 50% large, 30% mid, and 20% small. As you can see, this portfolio is well diversified in terms of sector, subsector, region, and market cap. These allocations will ultimately be up to you, as you will be in control of your portfolio.\n\n**Now You\u2019re Ready!**\n\nAnd that\u2019s it, we\u2019ve learned how to find stocks by looking at your surroundings using your own knowledge from your personal and work life and now you understand how to properly diversify a portfolio based on your own risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\n**Mainstreet**\n\nThis article is part of a series of articles aimed at assisting investors to take control of their wealth on Mainstreet.

However, even seasoned investors can find some use out of this by getting back to the basics. This quick guide isn't meant to focus on financial metrics, but in an effort to explore companies based on the world around us.\n\nPreface: This is directed for individuals that are just starting to invest, in hopes of empowering them to continue to grow upon the knowledge they learn on in this post! This is also a post to help highlight a new social investing platform I've been building called [Mainstreet](https://mainstreetportfolio.com/) (currently in beta) that helps you invest with your friends, track your portfolios, and build communities with one another. Happy investing!\n\n**How To Find Stocks (for the Normal Investor)**\n\nOne of the most common questions I get when talking to someone just getting into investing, is something along the lines of \u201cWhich stocks are good?\u201d or \u201cHow do I find stocks to invest in?\u201d. Some of the reasons individuals choose not to invest is due to the \u201clack of knowledge\u201d or perhaps they are \u201cintimidated by the market\u201d. These are all valid reasons to not invest, but I feel like by providing the education and resources to learn about these topics in an easy and digestible manner will help people overcome these barriers and feel empowered to take control of their wealth, whether it\u2019s through real estate, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll dive into some of the strategies and methods I used to help gain knowledge and insight when investing in the stock market. Keep in mind this is not the definitive guide, but it\u2019s steps that I took to help me become more financially literate about the stock market. Everyone\u2019s path to financial education is different and unique and this is only meant to provide a different perspective for someone just starting out.\n\n**Pay Attention to the World Around You**\n\nThe first thing I usually tell people is, start to observe the world around you and the businesses that are close to your network. You\u2019ll easily be able to find many companies if you start to shift your mindset and look at how the world functions.\n\nFirst, look at what kind of products or services you consume. Do you need to get your fix of vanilla latte at Starbucks ($SBUX) in the morning? More of a fast food person? Let\u2019s look at McDonalds ($MCD), Chipotle ($CMG), Shake Shack ($SHAK), or Restaurant Brands International ($QSR). Are you a hardcore gamer? Well, I\u2019m sure one of your games or consoles comes from Sony ($SNE), Nintendo ($NTDOY), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), or Microsoft ($MSFT). Or maybe you\u2019ve been working from home? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had to buy some products from Amazon ($AMZN) or Wayfair ($W) to spruce up your office space. You\u2019re probably also using things like Zoom ($ZM), Google Drive ($GOOG or $GOOGL), or Slack to keep yourself productive during the day.\n\n**Build a Watchlist**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got the brain working a little, it\u2019s important to start building a watchlist of all the stocks you\u2019ve thought of. You can use your broker watchlist tool, or even an app like Yahoo Finance, WeBull, etc. Sort them in a way that works for you, whether it\u2019s by sector (financial, tech, industrials), subsector (gaming, oil, e-commerce), or even by priority (Watchlist Tier 1, Watchlist Tier 2, etc.)\n\nOrganization is key when building your watchlist. You\u2019ll want to have them organized because it\u2019ll help you get a quick glance of what\u2019s happening in the market at any given time. By checking on the stocks you\u2019ve added to your watchlist periodically, you\u2019ll learn how they move according to catalysts (market news, earnings, etc) and be able to plan how and when you\u2019d like to invest in them.\n\n**Search within an Index Fund or ETF**\n\nA great way to search up companies is by looking at current index fund or ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) allocations. With index funds, you can look at the holdings of the S&amp;P500 (Top 500 American companies) or the Nasdaq 100 (Most active, largest 100 Nasdaq companies). At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of the S&amp;P500 are:\n\n1. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)\n2. Microsoft Corp ($MSFT)\n3. Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN)\n4. Facebook, Inc. ($FB)\n5. Alphabet Inc. Class A ($GOOGL)\n6. Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG)\n7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc ($BRK.B)\n8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ($JPM)\n9. Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA)\n10. Johnson &amp; Johnson ($JNJ)\n\nAnother way is to look into the holdings of an ETF. There are tons of ETFs out there that track indices like $SPY and $QQQ, which track the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, as well as more focused sector ETFs, like the ARK Innovation Fund ($ARKK) or the O\u2019Shares Global Internet Giants Fund ($OGIG).\n\nOne of my favorites is ARKK, as they focus on disruptive innovation and change. So, for example, if something like this was to resonate with you, looking into their top holdings will give you some insight on what kinds of companies you\u2019d need to do research on to gain exposure to this particular strategy. At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of ARKK are:\n\n1. Tesla, Inc ($TSLA)\n2. Teladoc Health, Inc. ($TDOC)\n3. Roku, Inc. ($ROKU)\n4. Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)\n5. Square, Inc. ($SQ)\n6. Shopify, Inc ($SHOP)\n7. Spotify Technology SA ($SPOT)\n8. Twilio, Inc (TWLO)\n9. Coinbase Global, Inc ($COIN)\n10. Unity Software, Inc ($U)\n\nHopefully looking into index funds or ETFs like the ones listed above help spark curiosity and the urge to build on your own knowledge!\n\n**Invest in Things You Understand (Personal, Business)**\n\nAnother piece of advice I like to give people is to only invest in areas of the market you understand. For example, if I see a sector like biotech or cybersecurity shoot up 50% in the last three months, but I don\u2019t really understand how this industry works, don\u2019t put your money in it. Simple as that. If the whole stock market started to fall, these will be the easiest to target as a potential sell because you don\u2019t understand the industry or the company at all. Your conviction on the stock is low so incentive to hold onto it for the long term is also low.\n\nFor me, I\u2019m a big gamer and I understand the industry well. To compare it to the previous example above, I can take those companies and further extrapolate to build upon my research using my existing knowledge. As a result, I\u2019m aware that gaming consoles use chips from Intel ($INTC), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), as well as GPU processors from Nvidia ($NVDA). Many video games are developed on software applications like Unity ($U). I\u2019m also aware that a large population of gamers and gaming companies come from Asia and Europe, therefore I can look into stocks like Ubisoft ($UBI), Capcom ($CCOEF), or even Tencent Holdings ($TCEHY). What about gaming accessories from Corsair ($CRSR) or Logitech ($LOGI)? And let\u2019s not forget about Gamestop ($GME)!\n\nAnother great way to leverage your knowledge is to look at your workplace and how the business is structured from within. Does your company utilize products or services from other companies? If you work at a software company, perhaps you use Cisco ($CSCO) or Ciena ($CIEN) for your networking. If your company uses customer or sales support, you may be using something like Salesforce ($CRM), Twilio ($TWLO), or Zendesk ($ZEN). To optimize your business, your company may also be leveraging cybersecurity services like Palo Alto ($PALO), Okta ($OKTA), or Crowdstrike ($CRWD). By looking within your own workplace, you\u2019ll be able to do a bit of deeper digging to find stocks that services businesses and aren\u2019t as customer facing.\n\nUnderstanding an industry well allows you to build your conviction in that industry. By fully grasping the ins and outs, you\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re invested in. This prevents panicking or selling if you suddenly see a red day, because you know what the company is fundamentally and potentially capable of. It also allows you to get invested in the companies you\u2019re buying, ultimately feeling like a small owner of the company, which is exactly what the function of stocks are.\n\n**Diversify your Portfolio**\n\nSo now, you\u2019ve done a bit of research and found a ton of stocks you might potentially invest in. Now what? Well, now is where you want to think about risk management and portfolio diversity.\n\nFrom Investopedia, diversification is a \u201crisk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\u201d\n\nHow do I know what\u2019s diversified enough? Great question, but that\u2019s up to your personal risk tolerance. Try not to allocate all your stocks into one single sector or area of the market. By broadening out in sector (tech, industrial), subsector (5G, banks), geography (US, Asia, Europe), market cap (large, medium, small), and more, you can feel comfortable and confident with your investments. The last thing you want to be doing is checking your stocks every minute and wondering if you should buy more or sell it off. Also consider the timeline of your allocations. The majority of my portfolio is in long-term investments (3+ years), but I do have a small portion of my portfolio allocated to mid-term and momentum investments (less than two years), such as options and swing trading. It\u2019s up to each individual investor to determine these allocations and stay committed to knowing when to change your allocation based on your time horizon.\n\nConsider this portfolio of $10000 dollars: (Stock, dollar amount\\[%\\], sector/subsector/geography/market cap)\n\n* Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA - $1000 (10%) - Tech / EV / USA / Large\n* Alibaba Group ($BABA) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / E-Commerce / ASIA / Large\n* Bank of America ($BAC) - $1000 (10%) - Financials / Banking / USA / Large\n* GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Pharma / EU / Large\n* Brookfield Renewable ($BEP)- $1000 (10%) - Energy / Renewable / CAN / Large\n* Papa John\u2019s Int. ($PZZA)- $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Consumer/ USA / Mid\n* Ubisoft Entertainment ($UBI) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / Gaming / EU / Mid\n* Barrick Gold ($GOLD) - $1000 (10%) - Industrials / Mining / CAN / Mid\n* Aurora Cannabis ($ACB) - $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Cannabis / CAN / Small\n* Nano-X Imaging ($NNOX) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Telehealth / Israel / Small\n\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve been able to allocate into many different sectors, subsectors, geographies, and market caps. If one of these companies were to disappear tomorrow, we\u2019d still have 90% of our portfolio remaining.\n\nOf our mock portfolio, our sector allocation is the following: 30% Technology, 20% Consumer, 20% Health, and 10% each in Financials, Energy, and Industrials. Our subsector allocation is fully diversified in 10 subsectors of the market: Electric Vehicles, E-Commerce, Banking, Pharma, Renewable Energy, Consumer, Gaming, Mining, Cannabis, and Telehealth. In terms of geography, our allocation is the following: 30% USA, 30% Canada, 20% Europe, 10% Asia, and 10% Israel. With our market cap, our allocation is the following: 50% large, 30% mid, and 20% small. As you can see, this portfolio is well diversified in terms of sector, subsector, region, and market cap. These allocations will ultimately be up to you, as you will be in control of your portfolio.\n\n**Now You\u2019re Ready!**\n\nAnd that\u2019s it, we\u2019ve learned how to find stocks by looking at your surroundings using your own knowledge from your personal and work life and now you understand how to properly diversify a portfolio based on your own risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\n**Mainstreet**\n\nThis article is part of a series of articles aimed at assisting investors to take control of their wealth on Mainstreet.

An investment\u2019s ESG score measures the sustainability of an investment in three specific categories: environmental, social and corporate governance.\n\nInvestors interested in environmental, social and governance issues often cite climate concerns as guiding their ESG investments.\n\nThey were rewarded during the market crash as oil prices cratered. In the first quarter, sustainability-focused funds held up better than the broader fund market during the initial bear market sell-off \u2013 driven in part by less exposure to fossil fuel energy.\n\nThat said, ESG goes beyond not buying petroleum companies; there's the \"S\" and the \"G\" parts, too, and those may take greater prominence as people focus on health care amid the pandemic and the social unrest triggered by systemic racism.\n\nThe global sustainable fund universe attracted $45.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020, versus an outflow of $384.7 billion from the overall fund universe. In the U.S. specifically, the research firm found that in the first quarter, flows into open-end and sustainable ETFs reached $10.5 billion, eclipsing the previous record set in 2019's fourth quarter.\n\nA June survey in 2020 from global investment manager Nuveen showed high-net-worth investors are starting to choose ESG for its outperformance, in addition to having a positive social impact, with 53% of respondents citing returns as their top reason to invest in ESG.\n\nAs such, it seems to be a wise choice to get started on an ESG portfolio. Here are some picks to get you started.\n\n***Coca-Cola (KO)***\n\nAs a mega-cap stock with a current market value around $250 billion, Coca-Cola has already partially recovered from the loss in sales due to the pandemic. Analysts suggest that by providing a dividend yield of approximately 3.1%, Coca-Cola makes the list of the top recovery stocks of 2021.\n\nMoreover, if you\u2019re looking for companies that strictly adhere to ESG policies, Coca-Cola has an AA rating from MSCI. The company performs exceptionally well when it comes to waste management, ensuring health and safety standards, and controlling the carbon footprint per product.\n\nThese attributes make it one of the leading ESG dividend stock companies in the beverage industry. Interestingly, only 15% have an AA rating from MSCI, while only 9% have a higher AAA rating.\n\n***Honeywell (HON)***\n\nHoneywell is an ESG-compliant company that shows high growth potential due to its share-price appreciation.\n\nThe Street predicts around 11% annual average growth for the company in the next few years, with a strong \u2018Buy\u2019 rating. Honeywell has consistently raised its dividends since 2014, going up from 45 cents per share to 95 cents last year.\n\nAs far as ESG compliance is concerned, Honeywell holds an AA rating from MSCI. Offering a dividend yield of 1.6%, Honeywell maintains its ESG rating among 14% of its industry peers, having the AA rating.\n\n***NVIDIA (NVDA)***\n\nThis is a well-known company producing graphics and video processing cards, remained unaffected by the pandemic. Analysts suggest that the company is bound to face the most prominent growth rate in the tech sector, surpassing artificial intelligence and auto technology. On the ESG end, NVIDIA is highly rated because of its mineral policy and effective corporate governance. The company uses rare minerals to build its chips and cards; therefore, it has a stringent policy against unethical procurement and mining of these minerals.\n\n***Chr. Hansen (CHYHY)***\n\nThe Danish human nutrition giant Chr. Hansen ranks high in ESG compliance due to its sustainable practices regarding food security and waste management. The company mainly produces bacteria that help curb the extended use of harmful pesticides while increasing crop yield at the same time.\n\nMoreover, Chr. Hansen has successfully developed an accounting system according to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. This helps the company assess the impact of each product and display the metrics to investors.\n\nThese extra measures place Chr. Hansen in the first place on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations List.\n\n***MBH Corporation (MBHCF)***\n\nMBH is a holding company actively building a portfolio of profitable, earnings accretive, debt-free small to medium enterprises (SME) that are expected to have a higher-than-normal growth profile as part of a larger organization. The company's operating model leaves management of the acquired companies to operate autonomously and fully accountable to develop and grow their businesses. As part of a larger organization, the acquired companies and in turn, MBH get the benefits of both worlds. This small holding company may have just started out, but it is pumping out revenue steadily and healthily and pays a 2% dividend. MBH Corporation has won five stars for their ESG credentials, getting into the top 1% of the nearly 2,000 businesses in the Support the Goals database. They have achieved this level of commitment through their work with inequality and climate goals. Support the Goals encourages businesses to take responsibility and the organisation expects companies 'to demonstrate how you support the world\u2019s most important action plan'.\n\n***NextEra Energy (NEE)***\n\nNextEra is the largest electric utility by market cap. Over the last few decades, the company has been consistently reducing its emissions through increased renewable energy use. Its CO2 emissions are 55% less than those of an average US utility. NextEra has now set an ambitious goal of reducing CO2 emissions, by 2025, by 67% from its 2005 base levels. This goal effectively means that absolute CO2 emissions would go down by 40% even while NextEra\u2019s energy production would double during that time. To its credit, the company last year received a best-in-class preparedness assessment by S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 ESG Evaluation.

An investment\u2019s ESG score measures the sustainability of an investment in three specific categories: environmental, social and corporate governance.\n\nInvestors interested in environmental, social and governance issues often cite climate concerns as guiding their ESG investments.\n\nThey were rewarded during the market crash as oil prices cratered. In the first quarter, sustainability-focused funds held up better than the broader fund market during the initial bear market sell-off \u2013 driven in part by less exposure to fossil fuel energy.\n\nThat said, ESG goes beyond not buying petroleum companies; there's the \"S\" and the \"G\" parts, too, and those may take greater prominence as people focus on health care amid the pandemic and the social unrest triggered by systemic racism.\n\nThe global sustainable fund universe attracted $45.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020, versus an outflow of $384.7 billion from the overall fund universe. In the U.S. specifically, the research firm found that in the first quarter, flows into open-end and sustainable ETFs reached $10.5 billion, eclipsing the previous record set in 2019's fourth quarter.\n\nA June survey in 2020 from global investment manager Nuveen showed high-net-worth investors are starting to choose ESG for its outperformance, in addition to having a positive social impact, with 53% of respondents citing returns as their top reason to invest in ESG.\n\nAs such, it seems to be a wise choice to get started on an ESG portfolio. Here are some picks to get you started.\n\n***Coca-Cola (KO)***\n\nAs a mega-cap stock with a current market value around $250 billion, Coca-Cola has already partially recovered from the loss in sales due to the pandemic. Analysts suggest that by providing a dividend yield of approximately 3.1%, Coca-Cola makes the list of the top recovery stocks of 2021.\n\nMoreover, if you\u2019re looking for companies that strictly adhere to ESG policies, Coca-Cola has an AA rating from MSCI. The company performs exceptionally well when it comes to waste management, ensuring health and safety standards, and controlling the carbon footprint per product.\n\nThese attributes make it one of the leading ESG dividend stock companies in the beverage industry. Interestingly, only 15% have an AA rating from MSCI, while only 9% have a higher AAA rating.\n\n***Honeywell (HON)***\n\nHoneywell is an ESG-compliant company that shows high growth potential due to its share-price appreciation.\n\nThe Street predicts around 11% annual average growth for the company in the next few years, with a strong \u2018Buy\u2019 rating. Honeywell has consistently raised its dividends since 2014, going up from 45 cents per share to 95 cents last year.\n\nAs far as ESG compliance is concerned, Honeywell holds an AA rating from MSCI. Offering a dividend yield of 1.6%, Honeywell maintains its ESG rating among 14% of its industry peers, having the AA rating.\n\n***NVIDIA (NVDA)***\n\nThis is a well-known company producing graphics and video processing cards, remained unaffected by the pandemic. Analysts suggest that the company is bound to face the most prominent growth rate in the tech sector, surpassing artificial intelligence and auto technology. On the ESG end, NVIDIA is highly rated because of its mineral policy and effective corporate governance. The company uses rare minerals to build its chips and cards; therefore, it has a stringent policy against unethical procurement and mining of these minerals.\n\n***Chr. Hansen (CHYHY)***\n\nThe Danish human nutrition giant Chr. Hansen ranks high in ESG compliance due to its sustainable practices regarding food security and waste management. The company mainly produces bacteria that help curb the extended use of harmful pesticides while increasing crop yield at the same time.\n\nMoreover, Chr. Hansen has successfully developed an accounting system according to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. This helps the company assess the impact of each product and display the metrics to investors.\n\nThese extra measures place Chr. Hansen in the first place on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations List.\n\n***MBH Corporation (MBHCF)***\n\nMBH is a holding company actively building a portfolio of profitable, earnings accretive, debt-free small to medium enterprises (SME) that are expected to have a higher-than-normal growth profile as part of a larger organization. The company's operating model leaves management of the acquired companies to operate autonomously and fully accountable to develop and grow their businesses. As part of a larger organization, the acquired companies and in turn, MBH get the benefits of both worlds. This small holding company may have just started out, but it is pumping out revenue steadily and healthily and pays a 2% dividend. MBH Corporation has won five stars for their ESG credentials, getting into the top 1% of the nearly 2,000 businesses in the Support the Goals database. They have achieved this level of commitment through their work with inequality and climate goals. Support the Goals encourages businesses to take responsibility and the organisation expects companies 'to demonstrate how you support the world\u2019s most important action plan'.\n\n***NextEra Energy (NEE)***\n\nNextEra is the largest electric utility by market cap. Over the last few decades, the company has been consistently reducing its emissions through increased renewable energy use. Its CO2 emissions are 55% less than those of an average US utility. NextEra has now set an ambitious goal of reducing CO2 emissions, by 2025, by 67% from its 2005 base levels. This goal effectively means that absolute CO2 emissions would go down by 40% even while NextEra\u2019s energy production would double during that time. To its credit, the company last year received a best-in-class preparedness assessment by S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 ESG Evaluation. NextEra has, essentially, received the highest ranking given by S&amp;P to a company within the utility sector.\n\n***Microsoft (MSFT)***\n\nMicrosoft has taken the lead in its commitment towards carbon mitigation by becoming the first company among its peers to target \u201ccarbon negative\u201d status by 2030. It has created a $1 billion fund to reduce emissions and start clearing carbon. This ambitious commitment is unprecedented and sets Microsoft apart from its entire sector. Microsoft received the highest ESG rating of AAA from MSCI ESG Research in September 2019.\n\n***Prologis (PLD)***\n\nPrologis is a logistics-focused REIT with multiple \u201cfirst company to\u2026\u201d accomplishments in the ESG space. Prologis is the first real estate company to issue green bonds. It is also the first real estate company to be awarded the WELL certification by the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI). Additionally, Prologis is the first logistics company to receive approved SBTs or \u201cScience-Based Targets\u201d necessary to meet the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement of 2015.
