An investment\u2019s ESG score measures the sustainability of an investment in three specific categories: environmental, social and corporate governance.\n\nInvestors interested in environmental, social and governance issues often cite climate concerns as guiding their ESG investments.\n\nThey were rewarded during the market crash as oil prices cratered. In the first quarter, sustainability-focused funds held up better than the broader fund market during the initial bear market sell-off \u2013 driven in part by less exposure to fossil fuel energy.\n\nThat said, ESG goes beyond not buying petroleum companies; there's the \"S\" and the \"G\" parts, too, and those may take greater prominence as people focus on health care amid the pandemic and the social unrest triggered by systemic racism.\n\nThe global sustainable fund universe attracted $45.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020, versus an outflow of $384.7 billion from the overall fund universe. In the U.S. specifically, the research firm found that in the first quarter, flows into open-end and sustainable ETFs reached $10.5 billion, eclipsing the previous record set in 2019's fourth quarter.\n\nA June survey in 2020 from global investment manager Nuveen showed high-net-worth investors are starting to choose ESG for its outperformance, in addition to having a positive social impact, with 53% of respondents citing returns as their top reason to invest in ESG.\n\nAs such, it seems to be a wise choice to get started on an ESG portfolio. Here are some picks to get you started.\n\n***Coca-Cola (KO)***\n\nAs a mega-cap stock with a current market value around $250 billion, Coca-Cola has already partially recovered from the loss in sales due to the pandemic. Analysts suggest that by providing a dividend yield of approximately 3.1%, Coca-Cola makes the list of the top recovery stocks of 2021.\n\nMoreover, if you\u2019re looking for companies that strictly adhere to ESG policies, Coca-Cola has an AA rating from MSCI. The company performs exceptionally well when it comes to waste management, ensuring health and safety standards, and controlling the carbon footprint per product.\n\nThese attributes make it one of the leading ESG dividend stock companies in the beverage industry. Interestingly, only 15% have an AA rating from MSCI, while only 9% have a higher AAA rating.\n\n***Honeywell (HON)***\n\nHoneywell is an ESG-compliant company that shows high growth potential due to its share-price appreciation.\n\nThe Street predicts around 11% annual average growth for the company in the next few years, with a strong \u2018Buy\u2019 rating. Honeywell has consistently raised its dividends since 2014, going up from 45 cents per share to 95 cents last year.\n\nAs far as ESG compliance is concerned, Honeywell holds an AA rating from MSCI. Offering a dividend yield of 1.6%, Honeywell maintains its ESG rating among 14% of its industry peers, having the AA rating.\n\n***NVIDIA (NVDA)***\n\nThis is a well-known company producing graphics and video processing cards, remained unaffected by the pandemic. Analysts suggest that the company is bound to face the most prominent growth rate in the tech sector, surpassing artificial intelligence and auto technology. On the ESG end, NVIDIA is highly rated because of its mineral policy and effective corporate governance. The company uses rare minerals to build its chips and cards; therefore, it has a stringent policy against unethical procurement and mining of these minerals.\n\n***Chr. Hansen (CHYHY)***\n\nThe Danish human nutrition giant Chr. Hansen ranks high in ESG compliance due to its sustainable practices regarding food security and waste management. The company mainly produces bacteria that help curb the extended use of harmful pesticides while increasing crop yield at the same time.\n\nMoreover, Chr. Hansen has successfully developed an accounting system according to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. This helps the company assess the impact of each product and display the metrics to investors.\n\nThese extra measures place Chr. Hansen in the first place on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations List.\n\n***MBH Corporation (MBHCF)***\n\nMBH is a holding company actively building a portfolio of profitable, earnings accretive, debt-free small to medium enterprises (SME) that are expected to have a higher-than-normal growth profile as part of a larger organization. The company's operating model leaves management of the acquired companies to operate autonomously and fully accountable to develop and grow their businesses. As part of a larger organization, the acquired companies and in turn, MBH get the benefits of both worlds. This small holding company may have just started out, but it is pumping out revenue steadily and healthily and pays a 2% dividend. MBH Corporation has won five stars for their ESG credentials, getting into the top 1% of the nearly 2,000 businesses in the Support the Goals database. They have achieved this level of commitment through their work with inequality and climate goals. Support the Goals encourages businesses to take responsibility and the organisation expects companies 'to demonstrate how you support the world\u2019s most important action plan'.\n\n***NextEra Energy (NEE)***\n\nNextEra is the largest electric utility by market cap. Over the last few decades, the company has been consistently reducing its emissions through increased renewable energy use. Its CO2 emissions are 55% less than those of an average US utility. NextEra has now set an ambitious goal of reducing CO2 emissions, by 2025, by 67% from its 2005 base levels. This goal effectively means that absolute CO2 emissions would go down by 40% even while NextEra\u2019s energy production would double during that time. To its credit, the company last year received a best-in-class preparedness assessment by S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 ESG Evaluation. NextEra has, essentially, received the highest ranking given by S&amp;P to a company within the utility sector.\n\n***Microsoft (MSFT)***\n\nMicrosoft has taken the lead in its commitment towards carbon mitigation by becoming the first company among its peers to target \u201ccarbon negative\u201d status by 2030. It has created a $1 billion fund to reduce emissions and start clearing carbon. This ambitious commitment is unprecedented and sets Microsoft apart from its entire sector. Microsoft received the highest ESG rating of AAA from MSCI ESG Research in September 2019.\n\n***Prologis (PLD)***\n\nPrologis is a logistics-focused REIT with multiple \u201cfirst company to\u2026\u201d accomplishments in the ESG space. Prologis is the first real estate company to issue green bonds. It is also the first real estate company to be awarded the WELL certification by the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI). Additionally, Prologis is the first logistics company to receive approved SBTs or \u201cScience-Based Targets\u201d necessary to meet the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement of 2015.

Over the last few decades, the company has been consistently reducing its emissions through increased renewable energy use. Its CO2 emissions are 55% less than those of an average US utility. NextEra has now set an ambitious goal of reducing CO2 emissions, by 2025, by 67% from its 2005 base levels. This goal effectively means that absolute CO2 emissions would go down by 40% even while NextEra\u2019s energy production would double during that time. To its credit, the company last year received a best-in-class preparedness assessment by S&amp;P Global Ratings\u2019 ESG Evaluation. NextEra has, essentially, received the highest ranking given by S&amp;P to a company within the utility sector.\n\n***Microsoft (MSFT)***\n\nMicrosoft has taken the lead in its commitment towards carbon mitigation by becoming the first company among its peers to target \u201ccarbon negative\u201d status by 2030. It has created a $1 billion fund to reduce emissions and start clearing carbon. This ambitious commitment is unprecedented and sets Microsoft apart from its entire sector. Microsoft received the highest ESG rating of AAA from MSCI ESG Research in September 2019.\n\n***Prologis (PLD)***\n\nPrologis is a logistics-focused REIT with multiple \u201cfirst company to\u2026\u201d accomplishments in the ESG space. Prologis is the first real estate company to issue green bonds. It is also the first real estate company to be awarded the WELL certification by the International WELL Building Institute (IWBI). Additionally, Prologis is the first logistics company to receive approved SBTs or \u201cScience-Based Targets\u201d necessary to meet the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement of 2015.

An investment\u2019s ESG score measures the sustainability of an investment in three specific categories: environmental, social and corporate governance.\n\nInvestors interested in environmental, social and governance issues often cite climate concerns as guiding their ESG investments.\n\nThey were rewarded during the market crash as oil prices cratered. In the first quarter, sustainability-focused funds held up better than the broader fund market during the initial bear market sell-off \u2013 driven in part by less exposure to fossil fuel energy.\n\nThat said, ESG goes beyond not buying petroleum companies; there's the \"S\" and the \"G\" parts, too, and those may take greater prominence as people focus on health care amid the pandemic and the social unrest triggered by systemic racism.\n\nThe global sustainable fund universe attracted $45.6 billion in the first quarter of 2020, versus an outflow of $384.7 billion from the overall fund universe. In the U.S. specifically, the research firm found that in the first quarter, flows into open-end and sustainable ETFs reached $10.5 billion, eclipsing the previous record set in 2019's fourth quarter.\n\nA June survey in 2020 from global investment manager Nuveen showed high-net-worth investors are starting to choose ESG for its outperformance, in addition to having a positive social impact, with 53% of respondents citing returns as their top reason to invest in ESG.\n\nAs such, it seems to be a wise choice to get started on an ESG portfolio. Here are some picks to get you started.\n\n***Coca-Cola (KO)***\n\nAs a mega-cap stock with a current market value around $250 billion, Coca-Cola has already partially recovered from the loss in sales due to the pandemic. Analysts suggest that by providing a dividend yield of approximately 3.1%, Coca-Cola makes the list of the top recovery stocks of 2021.\n\nMoreover, if you\u2019re looking for companies that strictly adhere to ESG policies, Coca-Cola has an AA rating from MSCI. The company performs exceptionally well when it comes to waste management, ensuring health and safety standards, and controlling the carbon footprint per product.\n\nThese attributes make it one of the leading ESG dividend stock companies in the beverage industry. Interestingly, only 15% have an AA rating from MSCI, while only 9% have a higher AAA rating.\n\n***Honeywell (HON)***\n\nHoneywell is an ESG-compliant company that shows high growth potential due to its share-price appreciation.\n\nThe Street predicts around 11% annual average growth for the company in the next few years, with a strong \u2018Buy\u2019 rating. Honeywell has consistently raised its dividends since 2014, going up from 45 cents per share to 95 cents last year.\n\nAs far as ESG compliance is concerned, Honeywell holds an AA rating from MSCI. Offering a dividend yield of 1.6%, Honeywell maintains its ESG rating among 14% of its industry peers, having the AA rating.\n\n***NVIDIA (NVDA)***\n\nThis is a well-known company producing graphics and video processing cards, remained unaffected by the pandemic. Analysts suggest that the company is bound to face the most prominent growth rate in the tech sector, surpassing artificial intelligence and auto technology. On the ESG end, NVIDIA is highly rated because of its mineral policy and effective corporate governance. The company uses rare minerals to build its chips and cards; therefore, it has a stringent policy against unethical procurement and mining of these minerals.\n\n***Chr. Hansen (CHYHY)***\n\nThe Danish human nutrition giant Chr. Hansen ranks high in ESG compliance due to its sustainable practices regarding food security and waste management. The company mainly produces bacteria that help curb the extended use of harmful pesticides while increasing crop yield at the same time.\n\nMoreover, Chr. Hansen has successfully developed an accounting system according to the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals. This helps the company assess the impact of each product and display the metrics to investors.\n\nThese extra measures place Chr. Hansen in the first place on the Corporate Knights Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations List.\n\n***MBH Corporation (MBHCF)***\n\nMBH is a holding company actively building a portfolio of profitable, earnings accretive, debt-free small to medium enterprises (SME) that are expected to have a higher-than-normal growth profile as part of a larger organization. The company's operating model leaves management of the acquired companies to operate autonomously and fully accountable to develop and grow their businesses. As part of a larger organization, the acquired companies and in turn, MBH get the benefits of both worlds. This small holding company may have just started out, but it is pumping out revenue steadily and healthily and pays a 2% dividend. MBH Corporation has won five stars for their ESG credentials, getting into the top 1% of the nearly 2,000 businesses in the Support the Goals database. They have achieved this level of commitment through their work with inequality and climate goals. Support the Goals encourages businesses to take responsibility and the organisation expects companies 'to demonstrate how you support the world\u2019s most important action plan'.\n\n***NextEra Energy (NEE)***\n\nNextEra is the largest electric utility by market cap. Over the last few decades, the company has been consistently reducing its emissions through increased renewable energy use. Its CO2 emissions are 55% less than those of an average US utility.

Im about to present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to 75x your  money\\*\\*.\\*\\* Too much, or too good to be true? Im being conservative. Hear  me out.\n\n**First, I shall Flex:**\n\n1. I  am an MD and a Professor. To spell out the obvious, I have insight into  what matters in the medical world. Many pure researchers lack this  (cough cough Elisabeth Bik). In addition, As medical school faculty, If I  can't figure it out, I know who to ask.\n2. I started investing (profitably) before most of you were born.\n\nWhy  flex? To make it abundantly clear, my opinion on biotech investing  matters just a little. With that said, once more, listen up!\n\n**The Pickle:**\n\nYou  youngins haven't noticed, but Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of  death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. The kicker is,  there is NO effective treatment.\n\nThe  FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm. This drug has  significant adverse events. The risk of brain swelling requires serial  Brain MRIs. It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV  infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k. Most incredible is  that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate  trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make  later).\n\nAgain, for emphasis, the  FDA still approved it because the need is that severe. President Biden  recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation  over a trillion dollars.\n\n**The Fix: $SAVA**\n\nCassava  Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive  function in its CMS trial. The degree and duration of improvement have  NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic.  It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that  behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it  doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the  discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.\n\nYes,  we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc. A genuine  criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased  critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the  usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives  conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the  ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.\n\nWithout  getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere  criticisms is Phase 3 trials. There is no valid argument against this  statement. This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use  absolute phrases. If you take away only one point from this article,  then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start  early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more  about him later). Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after  the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also  threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy. Be angry,  fellow apes, be angry. Im just getting started, BTW.\n\nDo  market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal?  They do. That is why the stock price went from &lt; $1 to an ATH of  $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my  family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the  first place.\n\n**The Villan and His Massacre:**\n\nJordan  Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a \"Citizens Petition.\"  A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit)  out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical  to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed  another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.\n\nEssentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second,  sold their shares. SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the  making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog ([https://ad-science.org/](https://ad-science.org/)),  Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it  biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.\n\n1. Jordan  Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that  patients are literally dying as they wait. WTF!? Why, why why?? If you  aren't angry, somethings wrong with you. JT states he is concerned for  patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there  is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected,  JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly.  In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did  JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that  is the \\*only\\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is  safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall  continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these  petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is  horrendous (3% success rate)? Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who  uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD  in its purest form.\n2. Then  why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous  document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe  even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my  position by 30%. With that said, Im not surprised the masses started  selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent,  it's an \\*opportunity\\*\u2014a second chance to buy the stock on clearance.\n\n**The Financials:**\n\n$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue.\n\nFifty  million patients are suffering from AD globally. 6 million of those  patients reside in the US. Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American  market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs  $20k annually, just a bit over a third the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's  soon to fail drug):\n\n1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000\n\nThat  calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up  as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment  options). The current stock price is $50. The overly conservative  valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750\n\nThe above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia.\n\n**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**\n\nIf  you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading  causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a  hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of  death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment.  Thats devastating for patients, but families? It's not uncommon for  families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they \"can't  handle it anymore.\" This market is massive and unaddressed! Severely,  painfully, and gravely unaddressed.\n\nI  have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires  (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process. JT is only the  face of this farce. Behind him are many short positions making a 100  million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their  short-term gain. There is something far more concerning.\n\n**The Plot Thickens:**\n\nWhat  I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or  short-term price action. There is something much more sinister. Biogen  has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved. Now it  is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a  problem:\n\nFDA advisory committee  voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then  saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently,  a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and  Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to  support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and  Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the  country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's  AD drug. This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you  to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no  other therapy on the market. Well, what happens if a new, more effective  medication shows up?\n\n**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**\n\nBack  to our Villian JT. JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the  initial \"Citizens Patetion\") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works. Why? I  speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous  whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried  about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in  profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is  more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer. There is  little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less. When that  happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug. Biogen already  has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to  rejuvenate the companies earnings. Then expediently and as expected,  Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.\n\nI  believe that is the root issue. Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become  furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam! A group of us have  gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to  investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).\n\n**Short term price action:**\n\n1. Im  expecting the SP to bounce. After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a  perfect overreaction play. If you dont know what Im talking about, you  can look up \"overreaction with reversion to the mean.\"\n2. Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within \"weeks to months.\"\n3. Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks. (\"Soon\" per Remi)\n4. Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.\n\n\\#SAVA's  float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted  with utilization of &gt;90%. It'll take very little to make SAVA move,  big. Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.\n\nI  have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on  SAVA. My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!). I'll  finish with one last piece of advice. Over 19 years of investing, my  most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading  and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment  by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further  propagated by \"experts\" tweeting and commenting with their hidden  agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual  published results, but apparently, her opinion counts? Comments of her  blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical  vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, \"oh, he sounds  smart, so he must be right.\" or \"That sounds complicated, he must be on  to something.\" In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical  details are fooling many. DFV saw something well before masses, and he  was paid handsomely for it.\n\nIf my  opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen,  then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in  with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs.  a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.\n\nI am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD before making any decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": -1}]}

To make it abundantly clear, my opinion on biotech investing  matters just a little. With that said, once more, listen up!\n\n**The Pickle:**\n\nYou  youngins haven't noticed, but Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of  death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. The kicker is,  there is NO effective treatment.\n\nThe  FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm. This drug has  significant adverse events. The risk of brain swelling requires serial  Brain MRIs. It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV  infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k. Most incredible is  that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate  trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make  later).\n\nAgain, for emphasis, the  FDA still approved it because the need is that severe. President Biden  recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation  over a trillion dollars.\n\n**The Fix: $SAVA**\n\nCassava  Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive  function in its CMS trial. The degree and duration of improvement have  NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic.  It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that  behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it  doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the  discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.\n\nYes,  we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc. A genuine  criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased  critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the  usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives  conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the  ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.\n\nWithout  getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere  criticisms is Phase 3 trials. There is no valid argument against this  statement. This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use  absolute phrases. If you take away only one point from this article,  then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start  early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more  about him later). Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after  the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also  threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy. Be angry,  fellow apes, be angry. Im just getting started, BTW.\n\nDo  market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal?  They do. That is why the stock price went from &lt; $1 to an ATH of  $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my  family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the  first place.\n\n**The Villan and His Massacre:**\n\nJordan  Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a \"Citizens Petition.\"  A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit)  out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical  to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed  another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.\n\nEssentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second,  sold their shares. SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the  making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog ([https://ad-science.org/](https://ad-science.org/)),  Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it  biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.\n\n1. Jordan  Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that  patients are literally dying as they wait. WTF!? Why, why why?? If you  aren't angry, somethings wrong with you. JT states he is concerned for  patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there  is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected,  JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly.  In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did  JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that  is the \\*only\\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is  safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall  continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these  petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is  horrendous (3% success rate)? Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who  uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD  in its purest form.\n2. Then  why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous  document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe  even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my  position by 30%. With that said, Im not surprised the masses started  selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent,  it's an \\*opportunity\\*\u2014a second chance to buy the stock on clearance.\n\n**The Financials:**\n\n$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue.\n\nFifty  million patients are suffering from AD globally. 6 million of those  patients reside in the US. Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American  market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs  $20k annually, just a bit over a third the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's  soon to fail drug):\n\n1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000\n\nThat  calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up  as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment  options). The current stock price is $50. The overly conservative  valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750\n\nThe above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia.\n\n**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**\n\nIf  you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading  causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a  hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of  death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment.  Thats devastating for patients, but families? It's not uncommon for  families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they \"can't  handle it anymore.\" This market is massive and unaddressed! Severely,  painfully, and gravely unaddressed.\n\nI  have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires  (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process. JT is only the  face of this farce. Behind him are many short positions making a 100  million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their  short-term gain. There is something far more concerning.\n\n**The Plot Thickens:**\n\nWhat  I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or  short-term price action. There is something much more sinister. Biogen  has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved. Now it  is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a  problem:\n\nFDA advisory committee  voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then  saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently,  a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and  Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to  support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and  Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the  country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's  AD drug. This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you  to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no  other therapy on the market. Well, what happens if a new, more effective  medication shows up?\n\n**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**\n\nBack  to our Villian JT. JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the  initial \"Citizens Patetion\") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works. Why? I  speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous  whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried  about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in  profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is  more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer. There is  little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less. When that  happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug. Biogen already  has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to  rejuvenate the companies earnings. Then expediently and as expected,  Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.\n\nI  believe that is the root issue. Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become  furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam! A group of us have  gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to  investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).\n\n**Short term price action:**\n\n1. Im  expecting the SP to bounce. After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a  perfect overreaction play. If you dont know what Im talking about, you  can look up \"overreaction with reversion to the mean.\"\n2. Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within \"weeks to months.\"\n3. Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks. (\"Soon\" per Remi)\n4. Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.\n\n\\#SAVA's  float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted  with utilization of &gt;90%. It'll take very little to make SAVA move,  big. Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.\n\nI  have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on  SAVA. My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!). I'll  finish with one last piece of advice. Over 19 years of investing, my  most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading  and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment  by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further  propagated by \"experts\" tweeting and commenting with their hidden  agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual  published results, but apparently, her opinion counts? Comments of her  blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical  vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, \"oh, he sounds  smart, so he must be right.\" or \"That sounds complicated, he must be on  to something.\" In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical  details are fooling many. DFV saw something well before masses, and he  was paid handsomely for it.\n\nIf my  opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen,  then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in  with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs.  a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.\n\nI am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD before making any decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": -1}]}

Severely,  painfully, and gravely unaddressed.\n\nI  have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires  (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process. JT is only the  face of this farce. Behind him are many short positions making a 100  million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their  short-term gain. There is something far more concerning.\n\n**The Plot Thickens:**\n\nWhat  I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or  short-term price action. There is something much more sinister. Biogen  has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved. Now it  is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a  problem:\n\nFDA advisory committee  voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then  saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently,  a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and  Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to  support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and  Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the  country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's  AD drug. This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you  to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no  other therapy on the market. Well, what happens if a new, more effective  medication shows up?\n\n**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**\n\nBack  to our Villian JT. JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the  initial \"Citizens Patetion\") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works. Why? I  speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous  whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried  about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in  profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is  more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer. There is  little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less. When that  happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug. Biogen already  has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to  rejuvenate the companies earnings. Then expediently and as expected,  Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.\n\nI  believe that is the root issue. Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become  furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam! A group of us have  gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to  investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).\n\n**Short term price action:**\n\n1. Im  expecting the SP to bounce. After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a  perfect overreaction play. If you dont know what Im talking about, you  can look up \"overreaction with reversion to the mean.\"\n2. Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within \"weeks to months.\"\n3. Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks. (\"Soon\" per Remi)\n4. Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.\n\n\\#SAVA's  float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted  with utilization of &gt;90%. It'll take very little to make SAVA move,  big. Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.\n\nI  have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on  SAVA. My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!). I'll  finish with one last piece of advice. Over 19 years of investing, my  most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading  and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment  by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further  propagated by \"experts\" tweeting and commenting with their hidden  agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual  published results, but apparently, her opinion counts? Comments of her  blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical  vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, \"oh, he sounds  smart, so he must be right.\" or \"That sounds complicated, he must be on  to something.\" In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical  details are fooling many. DFV saw something well before masses, and he  was paid handsomely for it.\n\nIf my  opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen,  then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in  with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs.  a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.\n\nI am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD before making any decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": -1}]}
