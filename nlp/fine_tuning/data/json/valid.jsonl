Im about to present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to 75x your  money\\*\\*.\\*\\* Too much, or too good to be true? Im being conservative. Hear  me out.\n\n**First, I shall Flex:**\n\n1. I  am an MD and a Professor. To spell out the obvious, I have insight into  what matters in the medical world. Many pure researchers lack this  (cough cough Elisabeth Bik). In addition, As medical school faculty, If I  can't figure it out, I know who to ask.\n2. I started investing (profitably) before most of you were born.\n\nWhy  flex? To make it abundantly clear, my opinion on biotech investing  matters just a little. With that said, once more, listen up!\n\n**The Pickle:**\n\nYou  youngins haven't noticed, but Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of  death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. The kicker is,  there is NO effective treatment.\n\nThe  FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm. This drug has  significant adverse events. The risk of brain swelling requires serial  Brain MRIs. It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV  infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k. Most incredible is  that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate  trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make  later).\n\nAgain, for emphasis, the  FDA still approved it because the need is that severe. President Biden  recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation  over a trillion dollars.\n\n**The Fix: $SAVA**\n\nCassava  Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive  function in its CMS trial. The degree and duration of improvement have  NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic.  It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that  behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it  doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the  discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.\n\nYes,  we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc. A genuine  criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased  critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the  usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives  conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the  ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.\n\nWithout  getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere  criticisms is Phase 3 trials. There is no valid argument against this  statement. This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use  absolute phrases. If you take away only one point from this article,  then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start  early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more  about him later). Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after  the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also  threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy. Be angry,  fellow apes, be angry. Im just getting started, BTW.\n\nDo  market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal?  They do. That is why the stock price went from &lt; $1 to an ATH of  $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my  family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the  first place.\n\n**The Villan and His Massacre:**\n\nJordan  Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a \"Citizens Petition.\"  A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit)  out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical  to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed  another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.\n\nEssentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second,  sold their shares. SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the  making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog ([https://ad-science.org/](https://ad-science.org/)),  Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it  biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.\n\n1. Jordan  Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that  patients are literally dying as they wait. WTF!? Why, why why?? If you  aren't angry, somethings wrong with you. JT states he is concerned for  patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there  is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected,  JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly.  In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did  JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that  is the \\*only\\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is  safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall  continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these  petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is  horrendous (3% success rate)? Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who  uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD  in its purest form.\n2. Then  why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous  document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe  even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my  position by 30%. With that said, Im not surprised the masses started  selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent,  it's an \\*opportunity\\*\u2014a second chance to buy the stock on clearance.\n\n**The Financials:**\n\n$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue.\n\nFifty  million patients are suffering from AD globally. 6 million of those  patients reside in the US. Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American  market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs  $20k annually, just a bit over a third the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's  soon to fail drug):\n\n1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000\n\nThat  calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up  as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment  options). The current stock price is $50. The overly conservative  valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750\n\nThe above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia.\n\n**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**\n\nIf  you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading  causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a  hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of  death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment.  Thats devastating for patients, but families? It's not uncommon for  families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they \"can't  handle it anymore.\" This market is massive and unaddressed! Severely,  painfully, and gravely unaddressed.\n\nI  have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires  (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process. JT is only the  face of this farce. Behind him are many short positions making a 100  million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their  short-term gain. There is something far more concerning.\n\n**The Plot Thickens:**\n\nWhat  I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or  short-term price action. There is something much more sinister. Biogen  has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved. Now it  is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a  problem:\n\nFDA advisory committee  voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then  saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently,  a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and  Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to  support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and  Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the  country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's  AD drug. This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you  to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no  other therapy on the market. Well, what happens if a new, more effective  medication shows up?\n\n**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**\n\nBack  to our Villian JT. JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the  initial \"Citizens Patetion\") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works. Why? I  speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous  whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried  about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in  profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is  more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer. There is  little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less. When that  happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug. Biogen already  has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to  rejuvenate the companies earnings. Then expediently and as expected,  Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.\n\nI  believe that is the root issue. Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become  furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam! A group of us have  gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to  investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).\n\n**Short term price action:**\n\n1. Im  expecting the SP to bounce. After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a  perfect overreaction play. If you dont know what Im talking about, you  can look up \"overreaction with reversion to the mean.\"\n2. Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within \"weeks to months.\"\n3. Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks. (\"Soon\" per Remi)\n4. Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.\n\n\\#SAVA's  float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted  with utilization of &gt;90%. It'll take very little to make SAVA move,  big. Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.\n\nI  have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on  SAVA. My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!). I'll  finish with one last piece of advice. Over 19 years of investing, my  most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading  and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment  by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further  propagated by \"experts\" tweeting and commenting with their hidden  agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual  published results, but apparently, her opinion counts? Comments of her  blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical  vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, \"oh, he sounds  smart, so he must be right.\" or \"That sounds complicated, he must be on  to something.\" In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical  details are fooling many. DFV saw something well before masses, and he  was paid handsomely for it.\n\nIf my  opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen,  then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in  with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs.  a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.\n\nI am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD before making any decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": -1}]}

However, even seasoned investors can find some use out of this by getting back to the basics. This quick guide isn't meant to focus on financial metrics, but in an effort to explore companies based on the world around us.\n\nPreface: This is directed for individuals that are just starting to invest, in hopes of empowering them to continue to grow upon the knowledge they learn on in this post! This is also a post to help highlight a new social investing platform I've been building called [Mainstreet](https://mainstreetportfolio.com/) (currently in beta) that helps you invest with your friends, track your portfolios, and build communities with one another. Happy investing!\n\n**How To Find Stocks (for the Normal Investor)**\n\nOne of the most common questions I get when talking to someone just getting into investing, is something along the lines of \u201cWhich stocks are good?\u201d or \u201cHow do I find stocks to invest in?\u201d. Some of the reasons individuals choose not to invest is due to the \u201clack of knowledge\u201d or perhaps they are \u201cintimidated by the market\u201d. These are all valid reasons to not invest, but I feel like by providing the education and resources to learn about these topics in an easy and digestible manner will help people overcome these barriers and feel empowered to take control of their wealth, whether it\u2019s through real estate, stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.\n\nIn this article, I\u2019ll dive into some of the strategies and methods I used to help gain knowledge and insight when investing in the stock market. Keep in mind this is not the definitive guide, but it\u2019s steps that I took to help me become more financially literate about the stock market. Everyone\u2019s path to financial education is different and unique and this is only meant to provide a different perspective for someone just starting out.\n\n**Pay Attention to the World Around You**\n\nThe first thing I usually tell people is, start to observe the world around you and the businesses that are close to your network. You\u2019ll easily be able to find many companies if you start to shift your mindset and look at how the world functions.\n\nFirst, look at what kind of products or services you consume. Do you need to get your fix of vanilla latte at Starbucks ($SBUX) in the morning? More of a fast food person? Let\u2019s look at McDonalds ($MCD), Chipotle ($CMG), Shake Shack ($SHAK), or Restaurant Brands International ($QSR). Are you a hardcore gamer? Well, I\u2019m sure one of your games or consoles comes from Sony ($SNE), Nintendo ($NTDOY), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), or Microsoft ($MSFT). Or maybe you\u2019ve been working from home? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had to buy some products from Amazon ($AMZN) or Wayfair ($W) to spruce up your office space. You\u2019re probably also using things like Zoom ($ZM), Google Drive ($GOOG or $GOOGL), or Slack to keep yourself productive during the day.\n\n**Build a Watchlist**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got the brain working a little, it\u2019s important to start building a watchlist of all the stocks you\u2019ve thought of. You can use your broker watchlist tool, or even an app like Yahoo Finance, WeBull, etc. Sort them in a way that works for you, whether it\u2019s by sector (financial, tech, industrials), subsector (gaming, oil, e-commerce), or even by priority (Watchlist Tier 1, Watchlist Tier 2, etc.)\n\nOrganization is key when building your watchlist. You\u2019ll want to have them organized because it\u2019ll help you get a quick glance of what\u2019s happening in the market at any given time. By checking on the stocks you\u2019ve added to your watchlist periodically, you\u2019ll learn how they move according to catalysts (market news, earnings, etc) and be able to plan how and when you\u2019d like to invest in them.\n\n**Search within an Index Fund or ETF**\n\nA great way to search up companies is by looking at current index fund or ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) allocations. With index funds, you can look at the holdings of the S&amp;P500 (Top 500 American companies) or the Nasdaq 100 (Most active, largest 100 Nasdaq companies). At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of the S&amp;P500 are:\n\n1. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)\n2. Microsoft Corp ($MSFT)\n3. Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN)\n4. Facebook, Inc. ($FB)\n5. Alphabet Inc. Class A ($GOOGL)\n6. Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG)\n7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc ($BRK.B)\n8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ($JPM)\n9. Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA)\n10. Johnson &amp; Johnson ($JNJ)\n\nAnother way is to look into the holdings of an ETF. There are tons of ETFs out there that track indices like $SPY and $QQQ, which track the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, as well as more focused sector ETFs, like the ARK Innovation Fund ($ARKK) or the O\u2019Shares Global Internet Giants Fund ($OGIG).\n\nOne of my favorites is ARKK, as they focus on disruptive innovation and change. So, for example, if something like this was to resonate with you, looking into their top holdings will give you some insight on what kinds of companies you\u2019d need to do research on to gain exposure to this particular strategy. At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of ARKK are:\n\n1. Tesla, Inc ($TSLA)\n2. Teladoc Health, Inc. ($TDOC)\n3. Roku, Inc. ($ROKU)\n4. Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)\n5. Square, Inc. ($SQ)\n6. Shopify, Inc ($SHOP)\n7. Spotify Technology SA ($SPOT)\n8. Twilio, Inc (TWLO)\n9. Coinbase Global, Inc ($COIN)\n10. Unity Software, Inc ($U)\n\nHopefully looking into index funds or ETFs like the ones listed above help spark curiosity and the urge to build on your own knowledge!\n\n**Invest in Things You Understand (Personal, Business)**\n\nAnother piece of advice I like to give people is to only invest in areas of the market you understand. For example, if I see a sector like biotech or cybersecurity shoot up 50% in the last three months, but I don\u2019t really understand how this industry works, don\u2019t put your money in it. Simple as that. If the whole stock market started to fall, these will be the easiest to target as a potential sell because you don\u2019t understand the industry or the company at all. Your conviction on the stock is low so incentive to hold onto it for the long term is also low.\n\nFor me, I\u2019m a big gamer and I understand the industry well. To compare it to the previous example above, I can take those companies and further extrapolate to build upon my research using my existing knowledge. As a result, I\u2019m aware that gaming consoles use chips from Intel ($INTC), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), as well as GPU processors from Nvidia ($NVDA). Many video games are developed on software applications like Unity ($U). I\u2019m also aware that a large population of gamers and gaming companies come from Asia and Europe, therefore I can look into stocks like Ubisoft ($UBI), Capcom ($CCOEF), or even Tencent Holdings ($TCEHY). What about gaming accessories from Corsair ($CRSR) or Logitech ($LOGI)? And let\u2019s not forget about Gamestop ($GME)!\n\nAnother great way to leverage your knowledge is to look at your workplace and how the business is structured from within. Does your company utilize products or services from other companies? If you work at a software company, perhaps you use Cisco ($CSCO) or Ciena ($CIEN) for your networking. If your company uses customer or sales support, you may be using something like Salesforce ($CRM), Twilio ($TWLO), or Zendesk ($ZEN). To optimize your business, your company may also be leveraging cybersecurity services like Palo Alto ($PALO), Okta ($OKTA), or Crowdstrike ($CRWD). By looking within your own workplace, you\u2019ll be able to do a bit of deeper digging to find stocks that services businesses and aren\u2019t as customer facing.\n\nUnderstanding an industry well allows you to build your conviction in that industry. By fully grasping the ins and outs, you\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re invested in. This prevents panicking or selling if you suddenly see a red day, because you know what the company is fundamentally and potentially capable of. It also allows you to get invested in the companies you\u2019re buying, ultimately feeling like a small owner of the company, which is exactly what the function of stocks are.\n\n**Diversify your Portfolio**\n\nSo now, you\u2019ve done a bit of research and found a ton of stocks you might potentially invest in. Now what? Well, now is where you want to think about risk management and portfolio diversity.\n\nFrom Investopedia, diversification is a \u201crisk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\u201d\n\nHow do I know what\u2019s diversified enough? Great question, but that\u2019s up to your personal risk tolerance. Try not to allocate all your stocks into one single sector or area of the market. By broadening out in sector (tech, industrial), subsector (5G, banks), geography (US, Asia, Europe), market cap (large, medium, small), and more, you can feel comfortable and confident with your investments. The last thing you want to be doing is checking your stocks every minute and wondering if you should buy more or sell it off. Also consider the timeline of your allocations. The majority of my portfolio is in long-term investments (3+ years), but I do have a small portion of my portfolio allocated to mid-term and momentum investments (less than two years), such as options and swing trading. It\u2019s up to each individual investor to determine these allocations and stay committed to knowing when to change your allocation based on your time horizon.\n\nConsider this portfolio of $10000 dollars: (Stock, dollar amount\\[%\\], sector/subsector/geography/market cap)\n\n* Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA - $1000 (10%) - Tech / EV / USA / Large\n* Alibaba Group ($BABA) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / E-Commerce / ASIA / Large\n* Bank of America ($BAC) - $1000 (10%) - Financials / Banking / USA / Large\n* GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Pharma / EU / Large\n* Brookfield Renewable ($BEP)- $1000 (10%) - Energy / Renewable / CAN / Large\n* Papa John\u2019s Int. ($PZZA)- $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Consumer/ USA / Mid\n* Ubisoft Entertainment ($UBI) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / Gaming / EU / Mid\n* Barrick Gold ($GOLD) - $1000 (10%) - Industrials / Mining / CAN / Mid\n* Aurora Cannabis ($ACB) - $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Cannabis / CAN / Small\n* Nano-X Imaging ($NNOX) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Telehealth / Israel / Small\n\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve been able to allocate into many different sectors, subsectors, geographies, and market caps. If one of these companies were to disappear tomorrow, we\u2019d still have 90% of our portfolio remaining.\n\nOf our mock portfolio, our sector allocation is the following: 30% Technology, 20% Consumer, 20% Health, and 10% each in Financials, Energy, and Industrials. Our subsector allocation is fully diversified in 10 subsectors of the market: Electric Vehicles, E-Commerce, Banking, Pharma, Renewable Energy, Consumer, Gaming, Mining, Cannabis, and Telehealth. In terms of geography, our allocation is the following: 30% USA, 30% Canada, 20% Europe, 10% Asia, and 10% Israel. With our market cap, our allocation is the following: 50% large, 30% mid, and 20% small. As you can see, this portfolio is well diversified in terms of sector, subsector, region, and market cap. These allocations will ultimately be up to you, as you will be in control of your portfolio.\n\n**Now You\u2019re Ready!**\n\nAnd that\u2019s it, we\u2019ve learned how to find stocks by looking at your surroundings using your own knowledge from your personal and work life and now you understand how to properly diversify a portfolio based on your own risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\n**Mainstreet**\n\nThis article is part of a series of articles aimed at assisting investors to take control of their wealth on Mainstreet.

Keep in mind this is not the definitive guide, but it\u2019s steps that I took to help me become more financially literate about the stock market. Everyone\u2019s path to financial education is different and unique and this is only meant to provide a different perspective for someone just starting out.\n\n**Pay Attention to the World Around You**\n\nThe first thing I usually tell people is, start to observe the world around you and the businesses that are close to your network. You\u2019ll easily be able to find many companies if you start to shift your mindset and look at how the world functions.\n\nFirst, look at what kind of products or services you consume. Do you need to get your fix of vanilla latte at Starbucks ($SBUX) in the morning? More of a fast food person? Let\u2019s look at McDonalds ($MCD), Chipotle ($CMG), Shake Shack ($SHAK), or Restaurant Brands International ($QSR). Are you a hardcore gamer? Well, I\u2019m sure one of your games or consoles comes from Sony ($SNE), Nintendo ($NTDOY), Activision Blizzard ($ATVI), Take-Two Interactive ($TTWO), or Microsoft ($MSFT). Or maybe you\u2019ve been working from home? I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had to buy some products from Amazon ($AMZN) or Wayfair ($W) to spruce up your office space. You\u2019re probably also using things like Zoom ($ZM), Google Drive ($GOOG or $GOOGL), or Slack to keep yourself productive during the day.\n\n**Build a Watchlist**\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got the brain working a little, it\u2019s important to start building a watchlist of all the stocks you\u2019ve thought of. You can use your broker watchlist tool, or even an app like Yahoo Finance, WeBull, etc. Sort them in a way that works for you, whether it\u2019s by sector (financial, tech, industrials), subsector (gaming, oil, e-commerce), or even by priority (Watchlist Tier 1, Watchlist Tier 2, etc.)\n\nOrganization is key when building your watchlist. You\u2019ll want to have them organized because it\u2019ll help you get a quick glance of what\u2019s happening in the market at any given time. By checking on the stocks you\u2019ve added to your watchlist periodically, you\u2019ll learn how they move according to catalysts (market news, earnings, etc) and be able to plan how and when you\u2019d like to invest in them.\n\n**Search within an Index Fund or ETF**\n\nA great way to search up companies is by looking at current index fund or ETF (Exchange Traded Fund) allocations. With index funds, you can look at the holdings of the S&amp;P500 (Top 500 American companies) or the Nasdaq 100 (Most active, largest 100 Nasdaq companies). At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of the S&amp;P500 are:\n\n1. Apple Inc. ($AAPL)\n2. Microsoft Corp ($MSFT)\n3. Amazon.com, Inc. ($AMZN)\n4. Facebook, Inc. ($FB)\n5. Alphabet Inc. Class A ($GOOGL)\n6. Alphabet Inc. Class C ($GOOG)\n7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc ($BRK.B)\n8. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. ($JPM)\n9. Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA)\n10. Johnson &amp; Johnson ($JNJ)\n\nAnother way is to look into the holdings of an ETF. There are tons of ETFs out there that track indices like $SPY and $QQQ, which track the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, as well as more focused sector ETFs, like the ARK Innovation Fund ($ARKK) or the O\u2019Shares Global Internet Giants Fund ($OGIG).\n\nOne of my favorites is ARKK, as they focus on disruptive innovation and change. So, for example, if something like this was to resonate with you, looking into their top holdings will give you some insight on what kinds of companies you\u2019d need to do research on to gain exposure to this particular strategy. At the time of publication, the top 10 holdings of ARKK are:\n\n1. Tesla, Inc ($TSLA)\n2. Teladoc Health, Inc. ($TDOC)\n3. Roku, Inc. ($ROKU)\n4. Zoom Video Communications ($ZM)\n5. Square, Inc. ($SQ)\n6. Shopify, Inc ($SHOP)\n7. Spotify Technology SA ($SPOT)\n8. Twilio, Inc (TWLO)\n9. Coinbase Global, Inc ($COIN)\n10. Unity Software, Inc ($U)\n\nHopefully looking into index funds or ETFs like the ones listed above help spark curiosity and the urge to build on your own knowledge!\n\n**Invest in Things You Understand (Personal, Business)**\n\nAnother piece of advice I like to give people is to only invest in areas of the market you understand. For example, if I see a sector like biotech or cybersecurity shoot up 50% in the last three months, but I don\u2019t really understand how this industry works, don\u2019t put your money in it. Simple as that. If the whole stock market started to fall, these will be the easiest to target as a potential sell because you don\u2019t understand the industry or the company at all. Your conviction on the stock is low so incentive to hold onto it for the long term is also low.\n\nFor me, I\u2019m a big gamer and I understand the industry well. To compare it to the previous example above, I can take those companies and further extrapolate to build upon my research using my existing knowledge. As a result, I\u2019m aware that gaming consoles use chips from Intel ($INTC), Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD), as well as GPU processors from Nvidia ($NVDA). Many video games are developed on software applications like Unity ($U). I\u2019m also aware that a large population of gamers and gaming companies come from Asia and Europe, therefore I can look into stocks like Ubisoft ($UBI), Capcom ($CCOEF), or even Tencent Holdings ($TCEHY). What about gaming accessories from Corsair ($CRSR) or Logitech ($LOGI)? And let\u2019s not forget about Gamestop ($GME)!\n\nAnother great way to leverage your knowledge is to look at your workplace and how the business is structured from within. Does your company utilize products or services from other companies? If you work at a software company, perhaps you use Cisco ($CSCO) or Ciena ($CIEN) for your networking. If your company uses customer or sales support, you may be using something like Salesforce ($CRM), Twilio ($TWLO), or Zendesk ($ZEN). To optimize your business, your company may also be leveraging cybersecurity services like Palo Alto ($PALO), Okta ($OKTA), or Crowdstrike ($CRWD). By looking within your own workplace, you\u2019ll be able to do a bit of deeper digging to find stocks that services businesses and aren\u2019t as customer facing.\n\nUnderstanding an industry well allows you to build your conviction in that industry. By fully grasping the ins and outs, you\u2019ll know exactly what you\u2019re invested in. This prevents panicking or selling if you suddenly see a red day, because you know what the company is fundamentally and potentially capable of. It also allows you to get invested in the companies you\u2019re buying, ultimately feeling like a small owner of the company, which is exactly what the function of stocks are.\n\n**Diversify your Portfolio**\n\nSo now, you\u2019ve done a bit of research and found a ton of stocks you might potentially invest in. Now what? Well, now is where you want to think about risk management and portfolio diversity.\n\nFrom Investopedia, diversification is a \u201crisk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\u201d\n\nHow do I know what\u2019s diversified enough? Great question, but that\u2019s up to your personal risk tolerance. Try not to allocate all your stocks into one single sector or area of the market. By broadening out in sector (tech, industrial), subsector (5G, banks), geography (US, Asia, Europe), market cap (large, medium, small), and more, you can feel comfortable and confident with your investments. The last thing you want to be doing is checking your stocks every minute and wondering if you should buy more or sell it off. Also consider the timeline of your allocations. The majority of my portfolio is in long-term investments (3+ years), but I do have a small portion of my portfolio allocated to mid-term and momentum investments (less than two years), such as options and swing trading. It\u2019s up to each individual investor to determine these allocations and stay committed to knowing when to change your allocation based on your time horizon.\n\nConsider this portfolio of $10000 dollars: (Stock, dollar amount\\[%\\], sector/subsector/geography/market cap)\n\n* Tesla, Inc. ($TSLA - $1000 (10%) - Tech / EV / USA / Large\n* Alibaba Group ($BABA) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / E-Commerce / ASIA / Large\n* Bank of America ($BAC) - $1000 (10%) - Financials / Banking / USA / Large\n* GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Pharma / EU / Large\n* Brookfield Renewable ($BEP)- $1000 (10%) - Energy / Renewable / CAN / Large\n* Papa John\u2019s Int. ($PZZA)- $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Consumer/ USA / Mid\n* Ubisoft Entertainment ($UBI) - $1000 (10%) - Tech / Gaming / EU / Mid\n* Barrick Gold ($GOLD) - $1000 (10%) - Industrials / Mining / CAN / Mid\n* Aurora Cannabis ($ACB) - $1000 (10%) - Consumer / Cannabis / CAN / Small\n* Nano-X Imaging ($NNOX) - $1000 (10%) - Health / Telehealth / Israel / Small\n\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve been able to allocate into many different sectors, subsectors, geographies, and market caps. If one of these companies were to disappear tomorrow, we\u2019d still have 90% of our portfolio remaining.\n\nOf our mock portfolio, our sector allocation is the following: 30% Technology, 20% Consumer, 20% Health, and 10% each in Financials, Energy, and Industrials. Our subsector allocation is fully diversified in 10 subsectors of the market: Electric Vehicles, E-Commerce, Banking, Pharma, Renewable Energy, Consumer, Gaming, Mining, Cannabis, and Telehealth. In terms of geography, our allocation is the following: 30% USA, 30% Canada, 20% Europe, 10% Asia, and 10% Israel. With our market cap, our allocation is the following: 50% large, 30% mid, and 20% small. As you can see, this portfolio is well diversified in terms of sector, subsector, region, and market cap. These allocations will ultimately be up to you, as you will be in control of your portfolio.\n\n**Now You\u2019re Ready!**\n\nAnd that\u2019s it, we\u2019ve learned how to find stocks by looking at your surroundings using your own knowledge from your personal and work life and now you understand how to properly diversify a portfolio based on your own risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\n**Mainstreet**\n\nThis article is part of a series of articles aimed at assisting investors to take control of their wealth on Mainstreet.

Im about to present a once-in-a-generation opportunity to 75x your  money\\*\\*.\\*\\* Too much, or too good to be true? Im being conservative. Hear  me out.\n\n**First, I shall Flex:**\n\n1. I  am an MD and a Professor. To spell out the obvious, I have insight into  what matters in the medical world. Many pure researchers lack this  (cough cough Elisabeth Bik). In addition, As medical school faculty, If I  can't figure it out, I know who to ask.\n2. I started investing (profitably) before most of you were born.\n\nWhy  flex? To make it abundantly clear, my opinion on biotech investing  matters just a little. With that said, once more, listen up!\n\n**The Pickle:**\n\nYou  youngins haven't noticed, but Alzheimer's is the 6th leading cause of  death in the US. Currently, Alzheimer's is an epidemic. The kicker is,  there is NO effective treatment.\n\nThe  FDA needed a drug so desperately they approved Aduhelm. This drug has  significant adverse events. The risk of brain swelling requires serial  Brain MRIs. It also requires a demented patient to sit through an IV  infusion (every six weeks) and costs more than $50k. Most incredible is  that Biogen's medication is NO BETTER THAN A SUGAR PILL in two separate  trials (so remember Biogen's drug sucks for a different point I'll make  later).\n\nAgain, for emphasis, the  FDA still approved it because the need is that severe. President Biden  recently pointed out that Alzheimer's disease could soon cost the nation  over a trillion dollars.\n\n**The Fix: $SAVA**\n\nCassava  Science's revolutionary Alzheimer's drug, Simufilam, improved cognitive  function in its CMS trial. The degree and duration of improvement have  NEVER been achieved, EVER for AD (Alzheimer's dementia)! It's historic.  It also enhanced behavior. Family members with AD patients know that  behavior is the overwhelming factor for family, but unfortunately, it  doesnt get enough attention. Lastly, and critically to patients (and the  discussion ahead), there were NO significant adverse events.\n\nYes,  we can argue about nuances like study design, the N, etc. A genuine  criticism of the study is its initially open-label. However, biased  critics will ignore Simufilams effect has been far more robust than the  usual placebo effect (88% vs. 30%). Those with ulterior motives  conveniently forget that a placebo arm is being introduced to the  ongoing phase 2 CMS study as we speak.\n\nWithout  getting too technical, the best way to settle the few sincere  criticisms is Phase 3 trials. There is no valid argument against this  statement. This is one of those few moments where it's safe to use  absolute phrases. If you take away only one point from this article,  then remember, Phase 3 trials should move forward. The study will start  early to mid-October at the dismay of Jordan Thomas (the villain, more  about him later). Anyone who disagrees with further testing is not after  the truth or and they are certainly not being objective. They are also  threatening a much-needed potential breakthrough therapy. Be angry,  fellow apes, be angry. Im just getting started, BTW.\n\nDo  market gurus like Blackrock and Vanguard believe this is a big deal?  They do. That is why the stock price went from &lt; $1 to an ATH of  $147. So is it a buy at $50 (market cap of 2 billion)? My advice to my  family is to load up! Now let's address why the stock crashed in the  first place.\n\n**The Villan and His Massacre:**\n\nJordan  Thomas, a scumbag lawyer, presented the FDA with a \"Citizens Petition.\"  A team shorting SAVA drafted this said Citizens Petition (not lawsuit)  out of concern for patient SAFETY (remember this point, it is critical  to understanding motives). If that wasn't enough, Jordan Thomas filed  another two addendums following the petitions over the last two weeks.\n\nEssentially, it was around 70 pages full of technical jargon and a myriad of inconsequential details. **The document was scary to read as an MD**.  Im sure the average person, first, shit in their pants, and, second,  sold their shares. SAVA fell 55% in 3 days (overreaction play in the  making? most definitely). As emotions have settled, this blog ([https://ad-science.org/](https://ad-science.org/)),  Cassava itself, and many experts, including myself, rightly called it  biased and fiction. The essentials from the petition and rebuttals.\n\n1. Jordan  Thomas has tried three times to halt clinical research on a drug that  patients are literally dying as they wait. WTF!? Why, why why?? If you  aren't angry, somethings wrong with you. JT states he is concerned for  patient safety. However, as also mentioned above (multiple times), there  is no evidence that Simufilam harmed a patient, period. So as expected,  JT is unable to offer proof of patient harm. You read that correctly.  In over seventy pages, there is no mention of patient harm. Then why did  JT cite safety as his concern, despite having NO evidence? Because that  is the \\*only\\* reason, the FDA will halt trials. Again, if Simufilam is  safe and has shown to be a potential treatment, then the study shall  continue. Oh, did I mention that the vast majority (&gt;90%) of these  petitions fail? Did I also note that Jordan Thomas' track record is  horrendous (3% success rate)? Synopsis: JT is an incompetent lawyer who  uses a failed method to frighten investors from their position using FUD  in its purest form.\n2. Then  why the massive selloff? As I mentioned earlier, reading an enormous  document full of details, even I, a literal verifiable SAVAge (maybe  even a SAVAnt?) and professor/physician, was overwhelmed and anxious.  Ultimately, I did not sell a single share. I did, however, increase my  position by 30%. With that said, Im not surprised the masses started  selling. Clearly, though, it was an overreaction. Even more apparent,  it's an \\*opportunity\\*\u2014a second chance to buy the stock on clearance.\n\n**The Financials:**\n\n$SAVA has 270 million in cash, no debt, and their cash burn is less than 20 million annually. Funding isn't a near-term issue.\n\nFifty  million patients are suffering from AD globally. 6 million of those  patients reside in the US. Let's say SAVA captures 1/4 of the American  market and nothing internationally. Further, let's say the therapy costs  $20k annually, just a bit over a third the cost of aducanumab (Biogen's  soon to fail drug):\n\n1,500,000 patients X $20,000 X 5 multiple = $150,000,000,000\n\nThat  calculation is ridiculously conservative for a Simufilam if it ends up  as good as it looks (in a market with no other effective treatment  options). The current stock price is $50. The overly conservative  valuation would put SAVA's SP at $3750\n\nThe above does not factor in SavaDx or expanded label use for seizures and other types of dementia.\n\n**Once Again Elaborating On The Need:**\n\nIf  you have a heart attack, Stroke, Pneumonia, or any of the leading  causes of death, there are treatments- actually, many treatments. I'm a  hospital-based physician and regularly see all the common causes of  death, so why does AD stand out? Again, there is no effective treatment.  Thats devastating for patients, but families? It's not uncommon for  families to drop their loved ones off in the ER because they \"can't  handle it anymore.\" This market is massive and unaddressed! Severely,  painfully, and gravely unaddressed.\n\nI  have little doubt that SAVA will make many believers millionaires  (SAVAilinaries?), but JT must stop delaying the process. JT is only the  face of this farce. Behind him are many short positions making a 100  million off deceit, but they are just pawns. Let them have their  short-term gain. There is something far more concerning.\n\n**The Plot Thickens:**\n\nWhat  I am concerned about goes far beyond 100 million in profit or  short-term price action. There is something much more sinister. Biogen  has spent over a billion dollars on getting its AD drug approved. Now it  is expecting to make many more billions in profit, but there is a  problem:\n\nFDA advisory committee  voted overwhelmingly against approval of Biogen's AD medication and then  saw a series of resignations in the approval's aftermath. Subsequently,  a special panel convened by the non-profit Institute of Clinical and  Economic Review unanimously (15-0) that the therapy lacks evidence to  support its clinical benefit. In addition, both the Cleveland Clinic and  Mount Sinai (two of the most distinguished medical centers in the  country) announced that they categorically refuse to administer Biogen's  AD drug. This is in addition to what I already mentioned above.  Essentially, their medication SUCKS (remember the key point I wanted you  to take away), but Biogen expects to make billions because there is no  other therapy on the market. Well, what happens if a new, more effective  medication shows up?\n\n**This Is Where It Gets Sinister:**\n\nBack  to our Villian JT. JT's supplement (submitted over a week after the  initial \"Citizens Patetion\") you'll notice something much more sinister.  JT is desperately trying to stop further proof Simufilam works. Why? I  speculate that big pharma (Biogen) is the unnamed/anonymous  whistleblower (not a citizen filing a petition). They aren't worried  about 100 million in profit; their concern is 100's of billions in  profit because Biogen's drug DOES. NOT. WORK vs. Simufilam, which is  more effective, cheaper, safer, and easier to administer. There is  little doubt the FDA will approve simufilam in a year or less. When that  happens, it is the nail in the coffin for Biogen drug. Biogen already  has declining revenue and is itself desperate for a medication to  rejuvenate the companies earnings. Then expediently and as expected,  Biogen is trying to stop SAVA desperately.\n\nI  believe that is the root issue. Yes, I hate shorters, but I have become  furious at Biogen trying to squash Simufliam! A group of us have  gathered much interest in counter suing JT and pressing Congress to  investigate this petition and its motives (more to come on that).\n\n**Short term price action:**\n\n1. Im  expecting the SP to bounce. After full-on panic selling, SAVA is a  perfect overreaction play. If you dont know what Im talking about, you  can look up \"overreaction with reversion to the mean.\"\n2. Remi Announced a non-dilutive, nondebt partnership announcement within \"weeks to months.\"\n3. Twelve-month data from the CMS trial has been collected and should be released within weeks. (\"Soon\" per Remi)\n4. Remi's fireside chat this Monday (9/13/21) at 7 AM at H.C. Wainwright's 23rd Annual Global Investment Conference.\n\n\\#SAVA's  float is less than 40 million, and currently, almost 27% is shorted  with utilization of &gt;90%. It'll take very little to make SAVA move,  big. Float is ten times lower than AMC and about 25% less than GME.\n\nI  have a lot to say, and if there is interest, I'll continue to post on  SAVA. My goal was to keep this post under 1000 words (failed!). I'll  finish with one last piece of advice. Over 19 years of investing, my  most successful plays have been opportunities others missed. Misleading  and misunderstood headlines have led to unjustified negative sentiment  by poorly informed investors. The half-assed research was further  propagated by \"experts\" tweeting and commenting with their hidden  agendas. Dr. Elisabeth Bik voiced concerns without looking at the actual  published results, but apparently, her opinion counts? Comments of her  blog documented this. All because a scumbag lawyer used technical  vernacular to cause panic. Something along the lines of, \"oh, he sounds  smart, so he must be right.\" or \"That sounds complicated, he must be on  to something.\" In reality, Jordan Thomas screamed fire in a theater.  Investors panicked and ran for the exits. Big words and technical  details are fooling many. DFV saw something well before masses, and he  was paid handsomely for it.\n\nIf my  opinion piece has motivated you to join SAVA's fight against Biogen,  then buy shares, spread the knowledge. Sleep well if you decide to go in  with me, knowing this is a righteous fight: six million AD patients vs.  a slimy lawyer, his short crew, and big Pharma.\n\nI am long. I have been wrong many times, and I am not a financial advisor. Do your own DD before making any decisions."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": 1}]}

The company also cited Microsoft\u2019s strong privacy protections.\n\nBackground: Netflix first publicly introduced the idea of adding a lower-priced ad-supported plan back in April. The streaming giant is known for having no ads, but with the number of subscribers dwindling and the number of streaming competitors increasing, Netflix needed to explore the ad-supported strategy.\n\nBig Picture: Meanwhile, Microsoft cut its guidance in June.
