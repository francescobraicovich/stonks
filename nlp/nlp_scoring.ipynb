They not only have focused on Retail operations but have also invested in other Cannabis companies where it makes sense against their portfolio. This quarter they out performed most Cannabis companies and made a profit. As they perfect the strains and further grow retail they will continue to invest in Cannabis companies. They stated on the conference call that they are looking at many international opportunities and North American Opportunities but probably over the next 3 or 4 years. They want to focus on perfecting distribution, supply and offering only a solid premium quality product in the Canadian market. The leadership team at SNDL are A+ business professionals and want to grow this company into a Cannabis Empire. Like I have said before .... If you Don’t think the leadership can lead SNDL to the top of the Cannabis Category, Then hold Zach Georges beer and watch this.😂',\n",

A franchise is incentivized to sell their cars at ACV because of the low fee structure, but independent dealers have had poor experiences. Franchise dealers are not buying from ACV, because of the arbitrary costs. Instead they will take trade ins and lease returns and survive off that for a few months. With this in mind, independent dealers are the ones buying. I encourage you to go on google and read dealer reviews. Complaints of poor arbitration, and inadequate condition reports are concerning. There's a reason why these auctions have always been physical and that is due to poor condition reports, dealers have been burnt so many times that they can no longer rely on any of the platforms technicians. Moreover, manheim offers the same service called Manheim Express, I cannot see how dealer adoption will be sustainable with manheim being the market leader. I am by no means an industry expert, nor is this investment advice, but those are some of my thoughts. Im interested in hearing yours.\",\n",
